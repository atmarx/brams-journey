# Cannabis as Medicine

!!! danger "Critical Legal and Safety Information"
    
    **Legal status:** Cannabis remains federally illegal in the United States, though many states have medical and/or recreational programs. Laws vary by country and jurisdiction. **Know your local laws before proceeding.**
    
    **Not for everyone:** Cannabis is contraindicated for some people. See the Safety Considerations section below.
    
    **This is educational information, not medical advice.** Work with a knowledgeable healthcare provider if you choose to explore medical cannabis.

## The Skeptic's Journey

Bram's initial reaction when Emma first suggested cannabis:

> *"That's for lazy stoners. I don't do drugs."*

His image: teenagers in basements, unmotivated, glassy-eyed. Not medicine. Not for serious people.

Emma's response:

> *"You were taking 2000mg of ibuprofen daily. That's a drug. And it was destroying your stomach."*

Valid point. But Bram's resistance wasn't rational—it was cultural, generational, tied to decades of propaganda.

What changed his mind wasn't arguments. It was desperation, data, and direct experience.

## Understanding the Endocannabinoid System

The human body has a built-in system designed to interact with cannabinoids:

![Diagram of the endocannabinoid system in the human body](../images/endocannabinoid-system-diagram.png)

**The [Endocannabinoid System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system) (ECS):**[^ecs-discovery]

- Network of receptors throughout the body (CB1, CB2)(1)
- Regulates inflammation, pain, mood, sleep, appetite, immune function[^ecs-functions]
- The body produces its own cannabinoids ([anandamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide), [2-AG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-Arachidonoylglycerol))
- Plant cannabinoids (from cannabis) interact with this system
{ .annotate }

1.  **CB1 receptors** are primarily found in the brain and central nervous system. **CB2 receptors** are mainly in the immune system and peripheral tissues.

[^ecs-discovery]: The endocannabinoid system was discovered in the early 1990s by researchers studying THC. See: Devane WA, et al. "Isolation and structure of a brain constituent that binds to the cannabinoid receptor." [*Science*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1470919/) 1992;258(5090):1946-1949.

[^ecs-functions]: Pacher P, et al. "The endocannabinoid system as an emerging target of pharmacotherapy." [*Pharmacol Rev*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2241751/) 2006;58(3):389-462.

!!! info "Key Insight"
    We're designed to use cannabinoids. This isn't some foreign drug—it's supporting a system that already exists in your body.

### Key Cannabinoids

**[CBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol) (Cannabidiol):**

- Non-psychoactive (doesn't get you "high")
- Anti-inflammatory[^cbd-inflammation]
- Anxiolytic (reduces anxiety)[^cbd-anxiety]
- Neuroprotective
- No addiction potential[^cbd-safety]
- Legal in most jurisdictions (when derived from hemp)

[^cbd-inflammation]: Burstein S. "Cannabidiol (CBD) and its analogs: a review of their effects on inflammation." [*Bioorg Med Chem*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25817177/) 2015;23(7):1377-1385.

[^cbd-anxiety]: Blessing EM, et al. "Cannabidiol as a Potential Treatment for Anxiety Disorders." [*Neurotherapeutics*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604171/) 2015;12(4):825-836.

[^cbd-safety]: WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence. "Cannabidiol (CBD) Critical Review Report." [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/controlled-substances/whocbdreportmay2018-2.pdf) 2018. Found CBD has "no potential for abuse."

**[THC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol) (Tetrahydrocannabinol):**

- Mildly psychoactive at higher doses
- Analgesic (pain relief)[^thc-pain]
- Anti-inflammatory
- Sleep-promoting[^thc-sleep]
- Muscle relaxant
- Requires more legal consideration

[^thc-pain]: Whiting PF, et al. "Cannabinoids for Medical Use: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis." [*JAMA*](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2338251) 2015;313(24):2456-2473.

**The Entourage Effect:** CBD + THC together often work better than either alone. The compounds modulate each other's effects.[^entourage]

## Medical vs. Recreational Use

These are completely different approaches:

| Aspect | Medical Use | Recreational Use |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Goal | Symptom relief | Intoxication |
| Dosing | Low, precise, consistent | Variable, often high |
| THC levels | Low to moderate (2.5–10mg) | High (25–100+mg) |
| Timing | Scheduled, strategic | Spontaneous |
| Feeling | Mild relaxation, like one glass of wine | "High" or intoxicated |
| Products | Tinctures, capsules, measured edibles | Smoking, high-dose products |

**Bram's approach was entirely medical:** precise dosing, consistent timing, minimal psychoactivity, maximum therapeutic benefit.

---

## Phase 1: CBD Only

Bram started conservatively—CBD only, no THC.

### The Protocol

**Week 1–3:**

- Morning: 25mg CBD oil (sublingual, hold under tongue 60 seconds)
- Mid-day: 15mg as needed for breakthrough pain
- Evening: 40mg before stretching routine

### The Experience

**Week 1:**

- No noticeable pain relief
- Slight improvement in sleep quality
- Maybe less irritable (hard to tell)
- No side effects
- No impairment whatsoever

*"This is expensive snake oil,"* Bram thought after day 5.

But he committed to the three-week trial.

**Week 3:**

Something had changed—so gradually he'd barely noticed:

- Baseline pain lower (3–4 instead of 5–6)
- Sleep definitely better
- Taking less ibuprofen (down from 6–8 pills to 2–4 daily)

!!! tip "CBD Patience Required"
    CBD isn't like ibuprofen—you won't feel immediate relief. It takes 2–3 weeks of consistent use to see full effects. It regulates inflammation at a systemic level, not just masking pain.

---

## Phase 2: Adding Low-Dose THC

Six weeks into CBD, Dr. Chen suggested adding small amounts of THC for enhanced pain relief and sleep.

Bram's resistance flared: *"I don't want to get high."*

Dr. Chen's response:

> *"You won't. We're talking 5–10mg of THC, combined with CBD. That's a therapeutic dose, not a recreational dose. You'll feel mild relaxation—like having one glass of wine, not like being intoxicated."*

### The First THC Experience

**Dose:** 5mg THC + 25mg CBD, after dinner, two hours before bed

**What Bram felt:**

| Time | Experience |
|------|------------|
| 15 min | Slight warmth in body |
| 30 min | Mild relaxation, similar to one glass of wine |
| 45 min | Evening stretching—could go deeper without pain |
| 90 min | Ready for bed (unusual—usually wired at night) |
| Sleep | 8 hours straight, deepest sleep in months |
| Morning | Refreshed, no grogginess, 5 min morning stiffness |

*"Huh. Okay."*

### Finding the Right Protocol

Over the next month, Bram dialed in his optimal dosing:

**Daytime:**

- 20–30mg CBD (morning and mid-day)
- No THC (needed to be clear-headed for work)

**Evening:**

- 30mg CBD + 10mg THC (2:1 ratio) after dinner
- Sometimes topical CBD/THC balm on knees and hands

**Nighttime (as needed):**

- 1:1 CBD:THC (15mg each) for sleep if pain was preventing rest

---

## Product Forms

| Form | Onset | Duration | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| Tinctures/oils | 15–45 min (sublingual) | 4–6 hours | Precise dosing, Bram's preference |
| Capsules | 1–2 hours | 6–8 hours | Consistent daily dosing |
| Edibles | 1–2 hours | 6–8 hours | Longer-lasting relief |
| Topicals | 15–30 min (local) | 2–4 hours | Localized joint pain |
| Vaping | 5–10 min | 2–3 hours | Acute breakthrough pain |
| Smoking | 5–10 min | 2–3 hours | NOT recommended (respiratory concerns) |

**Bram avoided smoking entirely**—respiratory concerns plus stigma/smell.

---

## Dosing Guidelines

!!! warning "Start Low, Go Slow"
    This is the golden rule. You can always take more; you can't take less.

### CBD Dosing

| Level | Dose | Use |
|-------|------|-----|
| Starting | 10–15mg | Test tolerance |
| Low | 15–25mg | Mild anxiety, sleep support |
| Moderate | 25–50mg | Pain, inflammation |
| High | 50–100mg | Severe symptoms |

### THC Dosing

| Level | Dose | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| Microdose | 1–2.5mg | Subtle, no impairment |
| Low | 2.5–5mg | Mild relaxation, therapeutic |
| Moderate | 5–10mg | Noticeable relaxation, some psychoactivity |
| High | 10–25mg | Significant psychoactivity (recreational territory) |
| Very high | 25mg+ | Strong intoxication (not medical use) |

### Ratios Matter

| Ratio (CBD:THC) | Effect | Best For |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| 20:1 or higher | Minimal psychoactivity | Daytime, anxiety |
| 4:1 to 10:1 | Very mild psychoactivity | Daytime pain |
| 2:1 | Mild psychoactivity | Evening pain relief |
| 1:1 | Moderate psychoactivity | Sleep, severe pain |
| High THC | Significant psychoactivity | Not for medical beginners |

## Quality Control

!!! danger "Not All Products Are Equal"
    Bram learned this the hard way—bought cheaper CBD oil from a gas station, noticed zero effects after two weeks. Lab testing revealed it contained 8mg CBD per serving instead of the labeled 25mg, plus contaminants.[^fda-warning]

[^fda-warning]: The FDA has issued multiple warning letters to companies selling mislabeled CBD products. See: [FDA Regulation of Cannabis and Cannabis-Derived Products](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd).

**Buy from licensed dispensaries.** Look for:

- Third-party lab testing (COA—Certificate of Analysis)(1)
- Accurate cannabinoid content
- No pesticides, heavy metals, or solvents
- Organic cultivation when possible
- Transparent company practices
{ .annotate }

1.  A **Certificate of Analysis (COA)** is a lab report showing exactly what's in the product—cannabinoid levels, terpene profile, and testing for contaminants like pesticides, heavy metals, and residual solvents. Reputable companies make these available on their websites.

**Quality costs more.** But ineffective medicine is more expensive.

## Safety Considerations

### Who Should NOT Use Cannabis

!!! danger "Contraindications"
    
    - **Pregnant or breastfeeding:** Can affect fetal/infant development[^acog-pregnancy]
    - **Personal or family history of psychosis/schizophrenia:** THC can trigger or worsen psychotic episodes[^lancet-psychosis]
    - **Adolescents and young adults under 25:** Brain still developing[^nida-brain]
    - **Certain heart conditions:** THC can increase heart rate and blood pressure[^cardio-risk]
    - **History of substance abuse:** May have higher risk of problematic use

[^acog-pregnancy]: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. "[Marijuana Use During Pregnancy and Lactation](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/10/marijuana-use-during-pregnancy-and-lactation)." Committee Opinion No. 722, 2017.

### Medication Interactions

Cannabis can interact with medications metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes:(1)
{ .annotate }

1.  **Cytochrome P450** is a family of liver enzymes responsible for metabolizing many drugs. CBD in particular can inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, potentially increasing blood levels of other medications.

- **Blood thinners** (increased bleeding risk)[^interactions]
- **Sedatives/benzodiazepines** (enhanced sedation)
- **Certain antidepressants**
- **Some blood pressure medications**
- **Immunosuppressants**

[^interactions]: Brown JD, Winterstein AG. "Potential Adverse Drug Events and Drug-Drug Interactions with Medical and Consumer Cannabidiol (CBD) Use." [*J Clin Med*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6678684/) 2019;8(7):989.

**Always inform your healthcare providers** about cannabis use.

### Impairment Warning

Even low-dose THC can impair:

- Driving ability
- Operation of machinery
- Complex decision-making
- Reaction time

**Do not drive or operate heavy machinery for 4–6 hours after THC use.** Legal and safe are different things.

### Tolerance and Dependence

Cannabis dependence is possible (about 9% of users), though less common than alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines.[^nida-dependence]

[^nida-dependence]: National Institute on Drug Abuse. "[Is marijuana addictive?](https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-addictive)" Research Report Series, 2020. Notes 9% overall dependence rate, rising to 17% for those who start in adolescence.

**Bram's approach to tolerance:**

- Every third week, skip THC for 3–4 days
- Effects reset after the break
- Prevents dose escalation

## Common Challenges

??? question "I feel nothing from CBD"
    Possibilities:
    
    - Product quality issue (common)—try a different, verified brand
    - Not enough time (need 2–3 weeks consistent use)
    - Dose too low—try increasing gradually
    - Individual variation—some people need higher doses

??? question "THC makes me anxious"
    This can happen, especially with higher doses or THC-dominant products.
    
    Solutions:
    
    - Lower the THC dose significantly
    - Increase CBD ratio (CBD modulates THC anxiety)
    - Try different strains (indica vs. sativa)
    - Some people simply don't tolerate THC well—CBD alone may be better

??? question "How do I talk to my doctor about this?"
    Be direct:
    
    > *"I'm interested in exploring medical cannabis for [condition]. I'd like your guidance on whether it's appropriate for me and how to use it safely."*
    
    Some doctors are knowledgeable; others aren't. If yours dismisses it without discussion, consider finding a cannabis-informed practitioner.

??? question "Will I fail a drug test?"
    - **CBD alone:** Usually no (but some products contain trace THC)
    - **Any THC:** Yes, it will show up for days to weeks depending on use frequency
    
    Know your employment situation before using THC.

??? question "Is this just getting high with extra steps?"
    At recreational doses, yes. At medical doses, no.
    
    5mg THC for pain relief is fundamentally different from 50mg THC for intoxication. The intent, experience, and outcomes are different.

## The Results

After 6 months using cannabis as part of his recovery protocol:

**Pain management:**

- Baseline pain: 2–3/10 (down from 7–8)
- Breakthrough pain episodes: Rare
- Ibuprofen use: Occasional, not daily
- Stomach issues from NSAIDs: Resolved

**Sleep:**

- Sleep quality: Dramatically improved
- Hours per night: 7–8 (up from 4–5 interrupted)
- Morning stiffness: 5 minutes (down from 45)

**Function:**

- Could do evening stretching routine more deeply (relaxed muscles)
- Better recovery between workdays
- Improved mood and stress tolerance

---

## Bram's Final Position

> *"I spent 20 years popping ibuprofen like candy, damaging my stomach and kidneys, because it was 'normal' and 'safe.' Then I used a plant that humans have used medicinally for thousands of years, and I was scared and ashamed because of propaganda.*
> 
> *Cannabis isn't a magic cure. It's one tool in a comprehensive healing approach. But it's a damn good tool. It reduced my inflammation, improved my sleep, and helped me manage pain without pharmaceutical side effects.*
> 
> *If you're in chronic pain, if inflammation is destroying your quality of life, if you've tried everything else—look into medical cannabis. Find a knowledgeable practitioner. Start low, go slow. Give it a fair trial.*
> 
> *And ignore anyone who judges you for using medicine that works."*
