# Invisible Exercise 5: Neck Retractions (Chin Tucks)

![Neck retraction demonstration](../images/exercises/neck-retractions.jpg)
<!-- TODO: Image showing side-by-side forward head vs corrected posture -->

**Purpose:** Correct forward head posture, strengthen deep neck flexors, reduce neck pain and headaches

**Duration:** 3 × 10-second holds (60 seconds total including rest)

---

## The Biomechanics

[Forward head posture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_head_posture) (FHP) is epidemic in modern life. For every inch your head moves forward:

- Effective weight on your [cervical spine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae) increases by 10 pounds
- A 12-pound head at 2 inches forward = 32 pounds of force on your neck

This creates a cascade of problems:

| Forward Head Effect | Result |
|---------------------|--------|
| [Neck extensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_triangle_of_the_neck) constantly working | [Trigger points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofascial_trigger_point), [tension headaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_headache) |
| Base of skull compression | Chronic headaches |
| [Thoracic spine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae) compensates | Upper back rounding |
| Shoulders round forward | [Shoulder impingement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_impingement_syndrome) |
| Breathing compromised | Reduced lung capacity |

**Neck retractions** strengthen the deep neck flexors ([longus colli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longus_colli_muscle), [longus capitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longus_capitis_muscle)) that should stabilize your head position, while lengthening the tight posterior neck muscles.

## Why This Matters for Contractors

Trade work creates constant forward head position:

- Looking down at tools, materials, work surfaces
- Driving with head forward toward windshield
- Checking phone during breaks
- Looking up for overhead work (then snapping back down)

By end of day: neck pain, reduced range of motion, tension headaches.

## How to Do It

### Setup

Stand or sit with upright posture. Look straight ahead (not up or down).

### The Movement

1. Keep jaw relaxed, teeth slightly apart
2. **Pull chin straight back**—horizontal translation
3. Think: "Make a double chin" or "Pull head back like it's on a rail"
4. **NOT:** Looking down (flexion) or up (extension)
5. **NOT:** Tilting head—pure horizontal movement backward
6. Feel stretch at base of skull, engagement at front of neck
7. Back of neck lengthens, crown of head lifts slightly
8. **Hold 10 seconds**
9. Release to neutral (don't let head drift forward)
10. Rest 10-15 seconds
11. Repeat 2-3 times

### The Key Concept

!!! info "Railroad Track Cue"
    Imagine your head is on a horizontal railroad track. It can only slide backward—no tilting, no nodding, no rotating. Pure horizontal translation.

---

## Form Critical Points

- **Horizontal movement only:** Head stays level, moves backward
- **Exaggerate initially:** Make very obvious double chin to learn movement
- **Breathe normally:** Don't hold breath
- **Jaw relaxed:** Tension in jaw means trying too hard
- **Eyes stay level:** Gaze at horizon throughout
- **Shoulders stay down:** Don't shrug or tense shoulders

---

## What It Should Feel Like

- Stretch at base of skull (where head meets neck)
- Lengthening of posterior neck
- Deep, subtle engagement at front of neck
- Double chin appearance (this means you're doing it right)
- Slight fatigue after hold if deep neck flexors are weak

**Should NOT feel:**

- Jaw clenching
- Pain
- Difficulty breathing
- Shoulder tension

---

## Variations

### Seated Version (For Truck/Office)

- Sit upright, back against seat
- Same retraction movement
- Use headrest as feedback—pull head into headrest
- Excellent for reversing driving posture

### Lying Version (Bedtime)

- Lie on back without pillow (or very flat pillow)
- Press back of head into surface
- Creates same chin tuck position
- Can hold longer (20-30 seconds)
- Great for pre-sleep routine

### Resisted Version (Advanced)

- Place hand on forehead
- Push head into hand while maintaining position
- Creates isometric resistance
- Hold 10 seconds
- Significantly increases deep neck flexor strength

## When to Do It

Neck retractions are the most invisible of the Invisible 8—slight chin movement that could be thoughtful nodding or normal head adjustment.

Best times:

- After looking down for extended periods
- After overhead work (looking up strains neck differently)
- During truck drives at stoplights
- While standing and planning
- Before/after phone use
- Multiple times per hour as needed

## Troubleshooting

??? question "Don't feel anything"
    - **Cause:** Not moving far enough, or already have good posture (rare)
    - **Solution:** Exaggerate significantly—make very obvious double chin
    - **Check:** Have someone watch from side—is head actually moving back?
    - **Measure:** Stand against wall, see if you can press head to wall

??? question "Looking down instead of pulling straight back"
    - **Cause:** Confusing neck flexion (nodding) with retraction (translation)
    - **Solution:** Keep eyes on horizon—they shouldn't look down
    - **Cue:** "Slide head back on horizontal rail, don't nod"
    - **Practice:** Do against wall—back of head should press into wall without tilting

??? question "Jaw pain or TMJ discomfort"
    - **Cause:** Clenching jaw during exercise
    - **Solution:** Keep jaw completely relaxed, teeth apart, tongue on roof of mouth
    - **If persists:** You may have existing [TMJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_dysfunction) issues

??? question "Headache or dizziness"
    - **Cause:** Possible vertebral artery issue or inner ear problem
    - **Action:** Stop immediately, don't repeat
    - **Medical:** See healthcare provider before attempting again

??? question "Neck muscles shake/tremble during hold"
    - **Cause:** Deep neck flexors very weak (common with chronic FHP)
    - **Reality:** This is good—means you're activating right muscles
    - **Solution:** Reduce hold to 5 seconds, build gradually
    - **Timeline:** Trembling reduces in 2-3 weeks

## Bram's Experience

**Week 1:** Couldn't believe how far forward his head was. When he pulled it back to proper position, it felt "weird and wrong." Deep neck flexors were so weak they trembled after 5 seconds. Looking in mirror: "I look like a turtle pulling into its shell." But also: immediate relief of pressure at base of skull.

**Week 2:** Could hold 10 seconds without trembling. Started doing these religiously after any forward work. Noticed he'd been having low-grade headaches constantly that he'd normalized—they started reducing.

**Week 4:** The corrected position started feeling more normal. Caught himself in forward head multiple times per day and corrected it. The retractions were building a new default posture.

**Week 8:** Automatic position awareness. When head drifted forward, he noticed immediately and corrected. Could do resisted version for 15 seconds. Neck felt stronger, more stable.

**Month 3:** New default head position established. Still did retractions several times daily, but more for maintenance than correction. Coworkers commented: "Your posture looks better."

**Month 6:** Complete transformation. Old photos looked wrong—could see how far forward his head used to be. Tension headaches essentially gone. Neck pain that had been constant background noise for years: eliminated.

## Real-World Impact

"I had tension headaches 3-4 times per week for years. Thought it was just part of getting older, part of physical work. After three months of neck retractions, I went six weeks without a single headache. Then realized: it wasn't age or work—it was my head position."

Specific improvements:

- **Driving:** "Used to arrive at job sites with stiff neck. Started doing chin tucks at every stop light. Neck stayed loose all day."

- **Overhead work:** "Looking up used to give me immediate neck strain. After strengthening deep flexors, I could work overhead for hours with minimal discomfort."

- **Sleep:** "Woke up with stiff neck less often. Better neck strength = better sleep position."

- **Concentration:** "Didn't realize brain fog was partly from chronic neck tension. Clearer head when neck wasn't fighting itself all day."

---

## The Invisible Factor

Standing and thinking, looking straight ahead, slight chin movement. Could be interpreted as thoughtful nodding or just normal head adjustment.

In truck: Sitting at a light, appearing to check mirrors or just relaxing. The movement is so subtle even passengers rarely notice.

You can do this mid-conversation. During meetings. On phone calls. The most invisible exercise there is.

## Integration

Neck Retractions are the **fifth of the Invisible 8** because:

- Address the signature dysfunction of modern workers (forward head)
- Prevent tension headaches
- Can be done constantly throughout the day
- Completely invisible to others

**Recommendation:** Multiple times per hour. After every forward-work session. At every stoplight. This should become automatic.
