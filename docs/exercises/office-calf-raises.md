# Calf Raises (Office Adaptation)

![Office calf raises](../images/exercises/office-calf-raises.jpg)
<!-- TODO: Image showing seated calf raise at desk, feet visible under desk -->

The office adaptation includes both **seated** and **standing** versions. The seated version is less range of motion but specifically addresses the circulation problems caused by prolonged sitting.

!!! tip "Quick Reference"
    - **Duration:** 15–20 reps (seated) or standard protocol (standing)
    - **Frequency:** Every 1–2 hours
    - **Visibility:** Seated version invisible; standing version looks like normal stretching
    - **Best times:** Phone calls, reading, waiting for printer/coffee

## Why It Matters for Desk Workers

Sitting creates a circulation crisis in your lower legs:

| Problem | Mechanism | Consequence |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Blood pooling | Gravity + no muscle pump | Ankle swelling, [varicose veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicose_veins) |
| [Venous stasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_stasis) | No calf contraction | [Deep vein thrombosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis) risk |
| Stiffness | Ankles locked at 90° for hours | Reduced mobility, [Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon) tightness |

Your calves are your "[second heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_muscle_pump)"—they pump blood back up to your core. When you sit, that pump stops working.

!!! danger "DVT Warning"
    Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in legs) is a real risk for prolonged sitters, especially on long flights or during intense work periods. Regular calf activation is genuine medical prevention.

## Seated Calf Raises (Primary Office Version)

### Setup
- Sitting in desk chair
- Feet flat on floor, about hip-width apart
- Knees at roughly 90°

### The Movement
1. Keep toes and balls of feet on ground
2. Lift heels as high as possible
3. Hold top position for 2 seconds—squeeze the calves
4. Lower slowly (3 seconds down)
5. Repeat 15–20 times

### What You Should Feel
- Calf muscles contracting and releasing
- Slight warmth in lower legs after a set
- "Pumping" sensation as blood moves

### Office Advantage
This version is **completely invisible** under a desk. You can do it during meetings, calls, or any seated work.

## Standing Calf Raises (When Possible)

Better range of motion than seated. Use these opportunities:

| Situation | How to Use It |
|-----------|---------------|
| Phone calls | Stand up, do calf raises while talking |
| Standing desk | Natural opportunity throughout day |
| Waiting for printer | 20 reps while page prints |
| Waiting for coffee | Full set while brewing |
| Waiting for microwave | Perfect 60–90 second window |
| Elevator wait | Quick set before doors open |

### Technique Reminder
- Rise onto balls of feet, squeeze at top
- Lower slowly below starting position (if on step)
- Control the movement—no bouncing

## The Circulation Protocol

For maximum circulation benefit during long sitting periods:

**Every 60 minutes:**

1. 20 seated calf raises
2. 10 ankle circles each direction
3. Point and flex feet 10 times

**Total time:** Under 2 minutes

**Result:** Blood flowing, ankles mobile, DVT risk reduced

## Best Office Timing

| Timing | Version | Visibility |
|--------|---------|------------|
| During meetings | Seated | Invisible |
| Video calls (camera on) | Seated | Invisible |
| Video calls (camera off) | Standing | N/A |
| Phone calls | Standing | Looks normal |
| Reading/email | Seated | Invisible |
| Waiting moments | Standing | Normal stretching |

## Common Office Challenges

??? question "My shoes make it awkward"
    Slip shoes off under desk for seated version—works much better barefoot or in socks. Or keep a pair of flat shoes at desk.

??? question "Chair rolls when I try"
    Lock chair wheels if possible, or brace feet against desk leg. Alternatively, do standing version more often.

??? question "Calves cramp during exercise"
    You're likely dehydrated. Increase water intake. Also reduce rep count initially and build up. Cramping usually resolves in 1–2 weeks.

??? question "I sit cross-legged"
    Uncross for calf raises—crossed position prevents proper engagement and worsens circulation. Consider breaking the cross-leg habit generally.

## Signs It's Working

**Week 1–2:**
- Less "heavy legs" feeling at end of day
- Reduced ankle stiffness when standing

**Month 1:**
- Noticeably less swelling in ankles/feet
- Easier to stand up after long sitting
- Calves feel more "alive"

**Month 3:**
- No more end-of-day leg heaviness
- Better ankle mobility overall
- Visible calf definition improving

## Combining with Other Exercises

Calf raises pair well with other seated exercises for an "invisible workout":

1. **Glute squeezes** (30 seconds)
2. **Calf raises** (20 reps)
3. **Stomach vacuum** (3 holds)

Total: 2 minutes. Completely invisible. Hit core, glutes, and circulation.
