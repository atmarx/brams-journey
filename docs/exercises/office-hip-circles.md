# Hip Circles (Office Adaptation)

![Office hip circles](../images/exercises/office-hip-circles.jpg)
<!-- TODO: Image showing standing hip circles in break room or by desk -->

The office adaptation includes a **seated version** for when standing isn't possible, though the standing version is preferred whenever you can find space.

!!! tip "Quick Reference"
    - **Duration:** 10 circles each direction, each hip
    - **Frequency:** Morning, mid-day, and before leaving (minimum)
    - **Visibility:** Standing version visible (looks like stretching); seated version semi-visible
    - **Best times:** Break room, by desk during phone calls, bathroom, private office

## Why It Matters for Desk Workers

### The Sitting Hip Problem

Your [hip joint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip) is designed for movement in every direction. Sitting locks it at 90° [flexion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion) for hours—the same position, all day, every day.

| What Sitting Does | Consequence |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Locks hips at 90° flexion | Other ranges stiffen |
| Compresses front of hip | [Hip flexors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_flexors) shorten |
| No rotation, [abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)), [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)) | These movements become restricted |
| Hours without movement | [Synovial fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_fluid) doesn't distribute |
| [Cartilage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular_cartilage) in one position | Uneven wear patterns |

**Hip circles are your "un-sitting" exercise.** They take your hips through ranges they never experience while seated.

### The Stand-Up Stiffness

Ever notice how stiff you feel standing up after long sitting? That's your hip joints protesting the sudden demand for ranges they haven't accessed in hours.

Hip circles throughout the day prevent this accumulation of stiffness.

## Standing Version (Preferred)

### Finding Space

| Location | Suitability |
|----------|-------------|
| Private office | Ideal—complete privacy |
| By your desk | Good if you can stand beside it |
| Break room | Good—looks like normal stretching |
| Bathroom | Privacy guaranteed |
| Phone calls (standing) | Productive use of call time |
| Standing desk | Natural integration |

### Technique

1. Stand near wall, desk, or chair for light balance support
2. Shift weight to left leg (right hip will circle)
3. Lift right knee to hip height (or as high as comfortable)
4. **Circle the knee:** forward → out to side → back → across midline
5. Make circles as large as possible without pain
6. 10 circles clockwise
7. 10 circles counterclockwise
8. Switch legs and repeat

### What You Should Feel

- Hip joint moving through full available range
- Gentle pulling/stretching in different positions of the circle
- Some "sticky spots" where movement feels restricted
- Warmth as joint mobilizes

## Seated Hip Circles (When Standing Not Possible)

### When to Use
- Open office with no private space
- Long meetings
- Can't leave desk

### Technique

1. Sit on edge of chair (not leaning back)
2. Lift one foot slightly off floor
3. Circle from hip with knee bent
4. 10 circles each direction
5. Switch legs

### Limitations
- Smaller range than standing version
- Less effective but still beneficial
- Better than no hip movement at all

### Making It Less Visible
- Smaller circles are less noticeable
- Can appear to be adjusting foot position
- Under-desk movement harder to observe

## The Office Hip Protocol

**Minimum daily requirement:**

| Time | Version | Duration |
|------|---------|----------|
| Morning (arriving) | Standing | 90 sec (both hips) |
| Mid-day (lunch) | Standing | 90 sec (both hips) |
| Before leaving | Standing | 90 sec (both hips) |

**Total: 4.5 minutes** spread across the day

**Enhanced protocol (if you sit 8+ hours):**

Add seated hip circles every 2 hours between the standing sessions.

---

## Integration Opportunities

### Phone Calls
Stand up for calls. While talking (muted or not), do hip circles. Productive use of otherwise static time.

### Bathroom Breaks
Take slightly longer bathroom breaks. Use the privacy for full standing hip circles. No one questions bathroom time.

### Coffee/Water Refills
Stand by the machine while it brews/fills. Hip circles while waiting.

### Before/After Meetings
Arrive early or stay late. Quick circles before sitting or after standing.

### Standing Desk Users
Even standing all day doesn't move your hips through full range. Regular circles still needed.

## Common Office Challenges

??? question "No private space for standing version"
    Options:
    
    - Bathroom (privacy guaranteed)
    - Stairwell (usually empty)
    - Outside building
    - By your car before entering
    - Seated version at desk (smaller but helps)

??? question "Balance issues when standing on one leg"
    Use more support—hold firmly onto desk, wall, or chair. Start with smaller circles that require less balance. Balance improves rapidly (1–2 weeks). The balance work is itself therapeutic.

??? question "Hip clicks or pops during circles"
    If painless, usually benign—tendons snapping over bony prominences. Continue exercise. If painful, reduce range and avoid the painful position. Persistent painful clicking warrants professional evaluation.

??? question "Can't lift knee very high"
    Start at whatever height is comfortable. This reveals exactly why you need this exercise—your hip flexion is restricted. Height will improve over weeks/months of consistent practice.

??? question "Feel it more in standing leg than circling leg"
    Normal—standing leg is working hard to stabilize. This is bonus single-leg strengthening. If it's too fatiguing, use more support and take breaks between sides.

??? question "Circles are jerky, not smooth"
    This indicates restricted ranges and poor motor control. Slow down significantly—take 5–6 seconds per circle. Smoothness develops with practice. Smaller circles are often smoother than large ones initially.

## The "After Sitting" Urgency

If you've been sitting for 2+ hours without movement, your first priority when standing should be hip circles.

**The post-sitting sequence:**

1. Stand up slowly
2. Hip circles immediately (even small ones)
3. Then proceed with whatever you're doing

This prevents the "locked up" feeling and reduces lower back strain from transitioning positions.

---

## Signs It's Working

**Week 1:**
- Circles feel awkward and restricted
- Some sticky spots and clicking
- Standing balance challenging

**Week 2–4:**
- Circles smoother and larger
- Fewer sticky spots
- Balance improving
- Less stiffness when standing from sitting

**Month 1–2:**
- Full, smooth circles
- Easy balance on either leg
- Hip mobility noticeably improved
- Getting up from floor/low positions easier

**Month 3+:**
- Dramatic improvement in hip function
- No more "locked up" feeling after sitting
- May notice improved squat depth
- Lower back strain from sitting reduced

## Pairing with Other Exercises

Hip circles address lower body mobility. Complete with:

- **Glute squeezes** — Hip stability + hip mobility = complete hip health
- **Calf raises** — Lower leg circulation while mobilizing hips
- **Standing hip flexor stretch** (from Daily 8) — Lengthens what sitting shortens

**The Standing Break Combo (2 minutes):**

1. Hip circles — 10 each direction, each hip (90 sec)
2. Calf raises — 15 reps (30 sec)

Do this every 2–3 hours for comprehensive lower body maintenance.

## The Sitting Disease Antidote

Sitting is increasingly called "the new smoking" for its health effects. Hip circles alone won't solve everything, but they directly address one of sitting's worst effects: hip joint deterioration.

Regular movement through full hip range:

- Distributes synovial fluid (joint lubrication)
- Prevents cartilage from wearing in limited positions
- Maintains mobility you'll need for decades
- Reduces compensation patterns in lower back and knees

**Your future self will thank you** for the 5 minutes per day of hip circles that preserved your hip function into old age.
