# Invisible Exercise 8: Wrist Circles

![Wrist circles demonstration](../images/exercises/wrist-circles.jpg)
<!-- TODO: Image showing wrist rotation with motion arrows -->

**Purpose:** Prevent [carpal tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome), maintain wrist mobility, reduce forearm tension, prevent [RSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) (repetitive strain injury)

**Duration:** Full sequence approximately 90 seconds

---

## The Biomechanics

The [wrist joint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist) is complex—multiple small bones ([carpals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_bones)) that must glide smoothly for proper function. Meanwhile, [forearm muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm#Muscles) control wrist and finger movement via long [tendons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon).

**What repetitive work does:**

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Constant gripping (tools, steering wheel) | Forearm muscle tension |
| Repetitive motion | Tendon adhesions |
| Limited positions | Restricted carpal bone movement |
| Vibration (power tools) | Soft tissue damage |

**The result:** Carpal tunnel symptoms, [tendinitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinitis), [arthritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis), grip weakness.

**Wrist circles** mobilize all wrist ranges ([flexion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion), [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)), [radial/ulnar deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_deviation)) and forearm rotation ([pronation/supination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronation)), distributing [synovial fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_fluid) and preventing adhesions.

## Why This Matters for Contractors

Your hands are your livelihood:

- Constant gripping: hammers, drills, saws, wrenches, steering wheel
- Repetitive impact (hammering) creates forearm inflammation
- Awkward wrist positions (overhead drilling, tight spaces)
- Vibration from power tools damages soft tissue

**Hand/wrist problems = inability to work.** Carpal tunnel surgery means 6-12 weeks recovery with potential permanent limitations.

Prevention is infinitely better than surgery.

## How to Do It

### Part A: Wrist Circles (10 each direction, each wrist)

1. Extend right arm forward, elbow straight but not locked
2. Hand at chest height
3. Make a loose fist or keep hand relaxed
4. **Rotate wrist in largest circle possible**
5. Move through: flexion (down) → radial deviation (thumb side) → extension (up) → ulnar deviation (pinky side)
6. Think: "Drawing a circle in the air with your knuckles"
7. 10 circles clockwise
8. 10 circles counterclockwise
9. Switch to left wrist, repeat

### Part B: Forearm Rotations (10 each arm)

1. Extend right arm forward, elbow at 90 degrees
2. Start with palm facing down (pronation)
3. Rotate forearm so palm faces up (supination)
4. Then rotate back to palm down
5. Full range of rotation, smooth movement
6. 10 full rotations (down-up-down = 1 rep)
7. Switch arms

### Part C: Finger Flexion/Extension (10 reps)

1. Extend arms forward
2. Spread fingers wide apart (extension)
3. Make tight fist (flexion)
4. Open-close-open = 1 rep
5. 10 reps
6. Addresses finger flexor/extensor balance

**Combined sequence:** All three parts take approximately 90 seconds total.

## Form Critical Points

- **Maximum range:** Go to end ranges in all directions without pain
- **Smooth, controlled:** No jerking or forcing
- **Both directions matter:** Each direction mobilizes different structures
- **Keep breathing:** Don't hold breath
- **No pain:** Stop before sharp pain (4-6/10 stretch okay, 7+ stop)
- **Relaxed shoulders:** Don't tense upper body
- **Full ROM:** Tiny circles don't achieve much—go big

---

## What It Should Feel Like

- Gentle pulling in different positions
- Clicking/popping (very common, usually benign if painless)
- Warming sensation as joint mobilizes
- Release of tension in forearms
- Some "sticky spots" (areas of restriction—improves with practice)
- Increased mobility immediately after

**Should NOT feel:**

- Sharp pain
- Numbness or tingling
- Grinding sensation
- Hot/inflamed feeling

---

## Variations

### Prayer Position Stretch (Complement)

- Press palms together in front of chest
- Lower hands toward waist, keeping palms together
- Stretches wrist flexors
- Hold 30 seconds

### Reverse Prayer (Complement)

- Place backs of hands together behind back
- Slide hands up spine
- Stretches wrist extensors
- Hold 30 seconds

### Tennis Ball Squeeze (Strengthening)

- Squeeze tennis ball firmly
- Hold 5 seconds, release
- 10-15 reps
- Builds grip strength
- Balance mobility work with strength

## When to Do It

Wrist circles look like normal stretching—completely normal office and job site behavior.

**Critical timing for contractors:**

- After extended tool use (especially power tools with vibration)
- Every 30-45 minutes during repetitive hand work
- After driving (steering wheel grip creates tension)
- Before detail work requiring dexterity
- Morning and evening for maintenance

**This is your primary carpal tunnel prevention.** Do it obsessively.

## Troubleshooting

??? question "Painful clicking or grinding"
    - **If painless clicking:** Usually benign, continue exercise
    - **If painful:** Reduce range significantly, avoid painful positions
    - **Constant painful grinding:** See healthcare provider
    - **Note:** Degenerative changes may limit safe range

??? question "Numbness or tingling during/after"
    - **Cause:** Possible nerve compression (carpal tunnel, [ulnar nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve))
    - **Action:** Stop immediately
    - **Check:** Is numbness in specific pattern? (thumb/index/middle = [median nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_nerve))
    - **Medical:** See provider—may need nerve conduction studies
    - **Alternative:** Focus on gentle forearm massage instead

??? question "Wrists so stiff circles are tiny"
    - **Cause:** Chronic immobility, possible arthritis, previous injury
    - **Reality:** This indicates you really need this exercise
    - **Solution:** Start with smallest circles possible, no pain
    - **Progress:** Gradually increase size over weeks/months
    - **Patience:** Wrist mobility can take 2-3 months to improve significantly

??? question "Forearm muscles cramp during rotations"
    - **Cause:** Severe tightness in flexors/extensors
    - **Solution:** Slow down, reduce range initially
    - **Hydration:** Ensure adequate water and electrolytes
    - **Frequency:** Do more often but gentler
    - **Massage:** Self-massage forearms before and after

??? question "One wrist much more restricted"
    - **Reality:** Very common, especially dominant hand
    - **Solution:** Spend extra time on restricted side
    - **Check:** Previous injury on restricted side?
    - **Note:** Non-dominant hand often has better mobility

??? question "Hands/fingers numb at night"
    - **Reality:** Wrist circles help prevent but may not cure established carpal tunnel
    - **Continue:** Keep doing circles—prevents worsening
    - **Night splints:** May need wrist braces at night
    - **Medical:** If severe or worsening, see provider

## Bram's Experience

**Week 1:** Wrists were embarrassingly stiff. Circles were tiny and jerky. Right wrist (dominant) worse than left. Constant clicking in both wrists. Forearms felt like concrete. "Twenty years of swinging hammers and my wrists move like rusty hinges."

After even the first session: immediate sensation of relief in forearms. Not dramatic, but noticeable loosening.

**Week 2:** Circles getting smoother and slightly larger. Started doing these religiously after any power tool use. Noticed: when he skipped them, hands felt tight and achy by evening. When he did them every hour, hands stayed loose.

**Week 4:** Significant improvement. Circles now much larger and smoother. Clicking reduced by about 50%. Could feel distinct difference between morning wrists (stiff) and post-circle wrists (mobile). Started doing them first thing in morning before work.

**Week 8:** Natural, fluid movement. Full range circles, no pain. The forearm tension that had been constant for years was essentially gone. Grip strength actually improved (not fighting constant tension).

**Month 3:** Wrist circles were automatic habit—did them constantly throughout day without thinking. Total game-changer for hand comfort. Could work all day with power tools without end-of-day hand cramping he'd normalized.

**Month 6:** Complete transformation. Wrists felt 20 years younger. The numbness in hands at night (early carpal tunnel symptoms he'd been ignoring) was gone. Full pain-free range of motion. Clicking essentially eliminated.

## Real-World Impact

"I was headed for carpal tunnel surgery. Numbness in hands at night, couldn't grip steering wheel for long without pain, dropping tools because grip would fail. Six months of daily wrist circles and all those symptoms are gone. *Gone.* Avoided surgery with 60 seconds a day of movement."

Specific improvements:

- **Power tool use:** "Drills, impact drivers, sanders—all create forearm tension. Before circles, I'd be fighting cramping by mid-afternoon. Now I do circles after each tool session and maintain loose forearms all day."

- **Hammering:** "Used to get hand cramping after extended hammering. Circles before and after eliminated this completely."

- **Detail work:** "Fine motor tasks require mobile wrists. My accuracy improved because my wrists could actually move properly."

- **Driving:** "Two-hour drives were torture—hands locked around steering wheel. Now I do wrist circles at every stop. Hands stay comfortable."

- **Sleep:** "The night numbness was terrifying—thought I'd need surgery. Wrist circles (plus night splints for 2 weeks) fixed it completely. I wake up with normal hands now."

## The Invisible Factor

Arms casually extended, appearing to stretch or relieve tension. Completely normal break behavior. Might look like examining hands, checking for cuts, or just casual fidgeting.

Can do while:

- Standing and talking with crew
- Waiting for materials
- On phone calls
- Watching a demonstration
- Any standing break

So invisible that Bram often did it mid-conversation without the other person noticing.

## Integration

Wrist Circles are the **eighth and final Invisible 8 exercise** because:

- Address the highest-risk area for permanent disability
- Complete the full-body coverage of the protocol
- Critical for anyone using tools
- Easy to do constantly throughout day

**Recommendation:** Every 30-45 minutes during hand-intensive work. After every power tool session. This is your carpal tunnel insurance policy.
