# Supine Spinal Twist

![Supine spinal twist position](../images/exercises/supine-spinal-twist.jpg)
<!-- TODO: Image needed - bird's eye view showing full body in twist -->

**Purpose:** Release lumbar spine rotation, decompress lower back, stretch hip external rotators

**Duration:** 2 minutes each side (4 minutes total)

## The Biomechanics

The [lumbar spine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae) should rotate 5-10° in each direction. Modern sitting and repetitive work reduces this rotational capacity:

- Loss of lumbar rotation forces the [thoracic spine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae) to compensate
- Compensating thoracic spine leads to mid-back pain
- The twist also stretches [piriformis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piriformis_muscle), [gluteus medius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteus_medius), and [IT band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_tract)

**Why supine (lying down)?**

- Gravity assists the stretch without muscular effort
- Spine is supported and stable—can't overdo it
- Both shoulders can remain grounded, preventing excessive rotation
- Allows complete relaxation, critical for [fascial release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia)

## Why This Matters for Contractors

Every pivot, turn, and twist at work requires spinal rotation:

- Turning to grab tools
- Twisting while carrying materials
- Getting in/out of truck
- Looking over shoulder

Without adequate lumbar rotation, these movements strain the spine. Restore the rotation, restore safe movement.

## How to Do It

### Setup

1. Lie on back on mat or carpet
2. Legs extended along floor
3. Arms out to sides in "T" position, palms down
4. Let whole back settle into floor
5. Scan body for tension, consciously relax

### The Movement (Right Side First)

1. Bend right knee, place right foot flat on floor near left knee
2. Right knee points toward ceiling
3. Keep left leg extended (can bend slightly if needed)
4. Using core (not momentum), guide right knee across body toward left
5. Let right knee lower toward floor on left side
6. **Knee doesn't need to touch floor**—wherever it lands with gravity is perfect
7. Turn head to look toward right hand (away from knee)
8. **Keep both shoulders on floor**—right shoulder will want to lift, gently encourage it down
9. Right arm remains extended

### Hold and Breathe

- Hold 2 minutes
- Breathe deeply into right side of ribcage
- Each exhale, allow slightly deeper relaxation
- Don't force knee down—let gravity work

### Switch Sides

- Engage core to bring knee back to center (don't use momentum)
- Rest 15-30 seconds in neutral
- Repeat with left knee crossing to right

---

## Form Critical Points

- **Let gravity work:** Don't force knee to floor
- **Both shoulders down:** This is what creates the twist through the spine
- **Head turns away:** Completes the spiral from hips to head
- **Breathe into the twist:** Expand ribcage on the stretched side
- **Relax everything:** The more you release, the deeper the stretch

---

## What It Should Feel Like

**Normal sensations:**

- Spiral twist through spine
- Stretch through hip and outer thigh
- Possible stretch through obliques (side abs)
- Opening across chest (if shoulder wants to lift)
- Gentle decompression in lower back

**Should NOT feel:**

- Sharp pain in lower back
- Catching or grinding in spine
- Numbness or tingling
- Knee pain

---

## Variations

### Gentle Version (Acute Back Pain)

- Bend both knees, feet flat on floor
- Let both knees drop together to one side
- Much less rotation, more supported
- Good starting point for very tight/painful backs

### Deeper Version (More Mobility)

- Place left hand on outside of right knee
- Apply gentle downward pressure
- Only if you can maintain shoulder contact with floor

### Hip Emphasis (Figure-4)

- Cross right ankle over left knee
- Then let both legs fall to left
- Deeper hip/piriformis stretch

## Troubleshooting

??? question "Shoulder lifts off ground when knee goes across"
    - **Reality:** Completely normal—very common
    - **Solution 1:** Use light hand pressure to remind it to stay grounded
    - **Solution 2:** Place yoga block or pillow under dropped knee
    - **Cue:** "Twist from the waist, not from forcing the knee down"
    - **Timeline:** Shoulder gradually stays down more (4-8 weeks)

??? question "Knee nowhere near floor (hangs in air)"
    - **Reality:** Perfect—that's your current mobility
    - **Don't force:** Gravity brings it lower over weeks/months
    - **Support it:** Place pillow/block under knee at current height
    - **Patience:** This stretch improves slowly
    - **Progress marker:** Take photo monthly to see improvement

??? question "Lower back feels tweaky or painful"
    - **Cause:** Too much rotation for current spinal tolerance
    - **Solution:** Reduce range—keep knee higher (closer to 45°)
    - **Modify:** Do gentler version (both knees together)
    - **Support:** Place pillow under twisted knee at comfortable height
    - **Check:** Are you forcing? Let gravity work

??? question "Feel it in IT band rather than lower back"
    - **Reality:** IT band is tight and limiting your rotation
    - **This is okay:** Stretch where the restriction is
    - **Over time:** IT band releases, allowing deeper spinal twist
    - **Consider:** Add foam rolling for IT band

??? question "Neck uncomfortable in turned position"
    - **Solution 1:** Keep head neutral (looking at ceiling) instead of turned
    - **Solution 2:** Place small towel under head for support
    - **Solution 3:** Turn head less (slight rotation, not full turn)

## Bram's Experience

**Week 1:** Right knee could barely cross midline—hung 45° in air. Right shoulder lifted 2-3 inches off ground immediately. Felt mostly in IT band and outer hip, barely any spinal twist. Restless and uncomfortable—wanted to come out after 30 seconds.

**Week 4:** Right knee could reach about 6 inches from floor. Right shoulder only lifted 1 inch. Starting to feel actual spinal rotation, not just hip/IT band. Could stay in position full 2 minutes with focus.

**Month 3:** Right knee could rest on floor (some days). Right shoulder stayed down with minimal effort. Deep spinal twist felt—releasing and decompressing. This became his "before bed" stretch—deeply relaxing.

---

## Real-World Impact

Bram noticed the impact most when getting in/out of his truck:

"I used to have to do this whole maneuver—couldn't just swing my legs and twist. My spine wouldn't rotate. After three months of this stretch, I could move normally again. Sounds simple, but it's quality of life."

He also found this stretch helped immediately after long drives:

"Ten minutes in the truck, five minutes of supine twists, and my back would feel human again."

**The decompression benefit:**

"Lying there with my knee across, I could feel my spine lengthening. Like gravity was gently pulling vertebrae apart. After a day of compression from standing and lifting, this felt like hitting a reset button."

## Integration

The Supine Spinal Twist is the **sixth stretch in the Daily 8** because:

- Transitions to floor work (from standing pec stretch)
- Addresses lumbar rotation after hip focus
- Provides decompression after active stretches
- Prepares body for the final restorative stretches

**Recommended:** Full 4 minutes (2 minutes each side) in evening routine. Can shorten to 2 minutes total in morning routine if needed.
