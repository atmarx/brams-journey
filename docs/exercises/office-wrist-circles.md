# Wrist Circles (Office Adaptation)

![Office wrist circles](../images/exercises/office-wrist-circles.jpg)
<!-- TODO: Image showing wrist circles at desk, looks like normal stretching -->

!!! danger "Absolutely Essential for Computer Users"
    [Carpal tunnel syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome) is **epidemic** in office workers. Keyboard and mouse work create constant [repetitive strain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) on wrists and forearms. Wrist circles are your primary prevention—do them obsessively.

The office adaptation requires no modification—wrist circles look like completely normal stretching at a desk.

!!! tip "Quick Reference"
    - **Duration:** 10 circles each direction, both wrists + finger flexion/extension
    - **Frequency:** Every 30–45 minutes during keyboard/mouse work
    - **Visibility:** Looks like normal stretching—completely acceptable
    - **Best times:** Between typing sessions, after meetings, during reading

## Why It's Essential for Office Workers

### The Keyboard/Mouse Strain Pattern

| Activity | Strain Created |
|----------|----------------|
| Typing | Fingers flexed, wrists often extended/deviated |
| Mouse use | Constant forearm [pronation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronation), grip tension |
| Phone holding | Wrist deviation, grip compression |
| Note-taking | Pen grip creates forearm tension |

**Hours of this daily creates:**

- [Forearm flexor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm#Anterior_compartment) tightness (muscles that close fingers)
- [Forearm extensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm#Posterior_compartment) strain (muscles that lift fingers)
- [Carpal tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel) compression ([median nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_nerve) pathway)
- Wrist stiffness in unused ranges
- [Tendinitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinitis) risk

### The Carpal Tunnel Cascade

```
Repetitive keyboard/mouse work
           ↓
Forearm flexors become tight and shortened
           ↓
Tight forearms compress carpal tunnel
           ↓
Median nerve compression
           ↓
Numbness, tingling, pain in hand (thumb, index, middle finger)
           ↓
Altered grip patterns → more strain
           ↓
Progressive worsening → surgery
```

**Wrist circles break this cycle** by mobilizing the joint and releasing forearm tension before it becomes pathological.

## The Complete Office Wrist Protocol

### Part A: Wrist Circles (60 seconds)

1. Extend right arm forward, elbow straight but not locked
2. Hand at chest height, loose fist or relaxed hand
3. **Circle wrist** through full range: down → thumb side → up → pinky side
4. Make circles as large as possible without pain
5. 10 circles clockwise
6. 10 circles counterclockwise
7. Switch to left wrist, repeat

### Part B: Forearm Rotations (30 seconds)

1. Extend right arm, elbow at 90°
2. Start palm down (pronation)
3. Rotate so palm faces up (supination)
4. Rotate back to palm down
5. 10 full rotations
6. Switch arms, repeat

### Part C: Finger Flexion/Extension (15 seconds)

1. Extend arms forward
2. Spread fingers wide apart (extension)
3. Make tight fist (flexion)
4. Open-close-open = 1 rep
5. 10 reps

**Total time:** 90 seconds for complete sequence

## Office-Specific Timing

!!! warning "Every 30–45 Minutes"
    This is not optional for keyboard workers. Set a timer. Your wrists cannot handle continuous typing without mobility breaks.

| Timing | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| Every 30–45 min | During keyboard/mouse work—non-negotiable |
| After extended typing | Email, document writing, data entry |
| After meetings | Note-taking creates forearm tension |
| Before/after phone use | Phone grip stresses forearms |
| Any time wrists feel stiff | Body is asking for mobility |

---

## Additional Office-Specific Stretches

Beyond the standard wrist circles, add these office-friendly stretches:

### Prayer Position Stretch (30 seconds)

1. Press palms together in front of chest (prayer position)
2. Keep palms together, lower hands toward waist
3. Feel stretch in wrist flexors (inside of forearms)
4. Hold 30 seconds
5. Excellent complement to circles

### Reverse Prayer (30 seconds)

1. Place backs of hands together in front of chest
2. Try to raise elbows while keeping hands together
3. Feel stretch in wrist extensors (top of forearms)
4. Hold 30 seconds
5. Addresses opposite muscle group

### Desk Edge Stretch (30 seconds each direction)

**Flexor stretch:**
1. Place palm flat on desk, fingers pointing toward you
2. Gently lean back, keeping palm flat
3. Feel stretch in inner forearm
4. Hold 30 seconds each arm

**Extensor stretch:**
1. Place back of hand flat on desk
2. Gently press down
3. Feel stretch in outer forearm
4. Hold 30 seconds each arm

## Ergonomic Considerations

Wrist circles work better when your workstation isn't constantly straining your wrists:

### Keyboard Position
- Keyboard at elbow height or slightly below
- Wrists neutral (not bent up or down)
- Consider split/ergonomic keyboard
- Wrist rest for support during pauses (not during typing)

### Mouse Position
- Mouse at same height as keyboard
- Arm supported, not reaching
- Consider vertical mouse (reduces pronation)
- Alternate hands if possible

### Typing Technique
- Float wrists while typing (don't rest on hard surface)
- Light touch—don't pound keys
- Take hands completely off keyboard during pauses

!!! tip "The Workstation Assessment"
    Look at your wrists while typing normally. Are they bent backward (extension)? Bent to the side (deviation)? Either position, held for hours, causes problems. Adjust keyboard height/angle until wrists are neutral.

## Warning Signs to Watch

| Symptom | What It May Indicate | Action |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| Numbness/tingling in thumb, index, middle finger | Carpal tunnel compression | Increase circles, see doctor if persists |
| Numbness in pinky and ring finger | [Ulnar nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve) issue | Different pathway—see doctor |
| Pain in wrist with movement | Tendinitis or strain | Rest, ice, reduce intensity |
| Weakness in grip | Possible nerve involvement | See doctor promptly |
| Night numbness/tingling | Classic carpal tunnel symptom | Night splints + see doctor |

**Don't ignore these signs.** Caught early, carpal tunnel can often be managed conservatively. Caught late, surgery may be required.

## Common Office Challenges

??? question "My wrists click and pop during circles"
    Very common, usually benign if painless. Continue exercise—clicking often reduces as mobility improves. If painful, reduce range and avoid painful positions.

??? question "Circles are tiny—wrists very restricted"
    This indicates exactly why you need this exercise. Start with whatever range you have. Consistency over weeks/months gradually increases range. Don't force—be patient.

??? question "Forearms cramp during exercise"
    Likely combination of dehydration and severe tightness. Increase water intake. Reduce rep count initially. Do more often but gentler. Self-massage forearms before and after. Usually resolves in 1–2 weeks.

??? question "One wrist much more restricted"
    Very common—usually dominant hand from mouse use. Spend extra time on restricted side (double the reps). May never achieve perfect symmetry, but gap should reduce.

??? question "Hands go numb at night"
    This is classic early carpal tunnel. Wrist circles help prevent worsening, but you may also need:
    
    - Night splints (keep wrists neutral while sleeping)
    - Ergonomic workstation assessment
    - Medical evaluation if severe or worsening

??? question "When should I see a doctor?"
    See a doctor if you have:
    
    - Persistent numbness or tingling
    - Weakness in grip or finger movement
    - Pain that doesn't improve with rest and circles
    - Symptoms that wake you from sleep
    - Any rapidly worsening symptoms

## Signs It's Working

**Week 1–2:**
- Circles feel smoother
- Less "stuck" feeling in wrists
- Some awareness of forearm tension

**Week 3–4:**
- Noticeably larger range of motion
- Forearms feel looser at end of day
- Less stiffness after long typing sessions

**Month 1–2:**
- Full, smooth circles
- No end-of-day wrist stiffness
- Clicking reduced or eliminated
- Better typing endurance

**Month 3+:**
- Wrist health becomes maintenance, not rehabilitation
- Can type/mouse for hours without discomfort
- Circles are automatic habit
- You notice immediately when you skip them

## The Lifetime Prevention Mindset

Consider: you may type for 40+ more years of your career.

**Without wrist care:**
- Progressive stiffness and strain
- Eventual carpal tunnel surgery (6–12 week recovery)
- Possible permanent limitations
- Career impact if you can't type

**With 2 minutes of wrist circles every 45 minutes:**
- Maintained mobility and function
- Surgery avoidance
- Full career without limitation
- Hands that work at 65 like they did at 35

**The math:** 2 minutes × 10 times per day = 20 minutes daily for lifetime hand function.
