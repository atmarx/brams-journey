# Scapular Wall Slides (Office Adaptation)

![Office scapular wall slides](../images/exercises/office-scapular-wall-slides.jpg)
<!-- TODO: Image showing seated chair version or wall version in office break room -->

The office adaptation includes a **seated chair version** for when you can't access a wall, plus guidance on finding appropriate wall space in office environments.

!!! tip "Quick Reference"
    - **Duration:** 8–10 reps
    - **Frequency:** Every 90 minutes of computer work (non-negotiable)
    - **Visibility:** Wall version visible but looks like normal stretching; chair version semi-visible
    - **Best times:** Break room, before/after presentations, bathroom break

## Why It Matters for Desk Workers

Computer posture creates a specific dysfunction pattern:

```
Hours of keyboard/mouse work
        ↓
Shoulders round forward
        ↓
[Chest muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectoralis_major) shorten
        ↓
Upper back muscles weaken
        ↓
[Shoulder blades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapula) wing out ([protraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protraction_(kinesiology)))
        ↓
[Shoulder impingement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_impingement_syndrome), neck pain, headaches
```

Scapular wall slides directly reverse this pattern by:

- Opening the chest
- Strengthening upper back
- Teaching proper shoulder blade positioning
- Restoring overhead mobility

!!! warning "The Presentation Problem"
    Rounded shoulders don't just cause pain—they project low confidence. Before any presentation or important meeting, scapular wall slides open your chest and improve your posture instantly.

## Wall Version (Preferred)

### Finding Wall Space

| Location | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Break room | Usually has clear wall | May have observers |
| Hallway | Long clear walls | High traffic |
| Private office | Complete privacy | Not everyone has one |
| Bathroom | Privacy guaranteed | Limited space |
| Stairwell | Usually empty | Awkward if someone enters |
| Outside building | Fresh air bonus | Weather dependent |

### Technique Reminder

1. Back flat against wall, feet 6 inches from wall
2. Arms in "goalpost" position against wall
3. Slide arms up while maintaining wall contact
4. Slide back down slowly
5. 8–10 reps

**Office tip:** Looks like you're just stretching during a break—completely normal behavior.

## Seated Chair Version (When No Wall Available)

### Setup
- Sit tall in chair with back against backrest
- Scoot hips back so entire spine contacts chair back
- Feet flat on floor

### The Movement
1. Raise arms to "goalpost" position (elbows at shoulder height, bent 90°)
2. Press elbows and backs of hands toward chair back
3. Slide arms upward as far as possible while maintaining contact
4. Feel shoulder blades squeeze together and move down
5. Slide back to starting position
6. 8–10 reps

### Limitations
- Smaller range of motion than wall version
- Chair back may not be flat (curved ergonomic chairs are harder)
- Still beneficial, but wall version is superior

### When to Use
- Open office with no private wall access
- During long meetings (subtle version)
- Quick posture reset without leaving desk

## Office-Specific Timing

| Trigger | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Every 90 minutes of screen work | Non-negotiable—set timer if needed |
| Before presentations | Opens chest, projects confidence |
| After presentations | Release tension from "presenter posture" |
| Before video calls | Better on-camera posture |
| After long typing sessions | Counter forward reach |
| When shoulders feel "heavy" | Body asking for reset |

---

## The Pre-Presentation Protocol

Before any important meeting or presentation:

1. Find wall (bathroom works)
2. 8–10 wall slides
3. Hold final position 10 seconds
4. 3 deep breaths with chest open
5. Enter room with shoulders back

**Result:** Better posture, more confident appearance, reduced tension.

## Common Office Challenges

??? question "No private wall space available"
    Use the seated version, or find creative locations: stairwell, parking garage pillar, outside building wall. Even bathroom stall walls work in a pinch.

??? question "Coworkers look at me weird"
    "Just stretching—my physical therapist recommended it." End of conversation. Or do it in bathroom/stairwell until it becomes normalized in your office culture.

??? question "My chair is curved, not flat"
    Ergonomic chairs with curved backs make the seated version harder. Options:
    
    - Sit on chair edge, use wall behind you
    - Find a flat-backed chair in conference room
    - Prioritize wall version during breaks

??? question "Arms won't stay against wall/chair"
    This reveals exactly why you need this exercise—your chest is too tight. Start with whatever range you can achieve with contact maintained. Range improves over weeks.

## Signs It's Working

**Week 1–2:**
- Easier to maintain wall contact throughout movement
- Shoulders feel "looser" after doing slides
- Slight increase in overhead range

**Month 1:**
- Natural posture improving (shoulders less rounded)
- Less upper back fatigue at end of day
- Can reach higher with arms overhead

**Month 3:**
- Shoulder blades sit flatter against back
- Coworkers may comment on improved posture
- Significant reduction in upper back/neck tension

## Pairing with Other Exercises

Scapular wall slides work synergistically with:

- **Shoulder blade squeezes** — Both target scapular positioning
- **Neck retractions** — Complete upper body postural reset
- **Doorway pec stretch** (from Daily 8) — Addresses same tightness pattern

**Power combo for break time:**

1. Wall slides (60 seconds)
2. Shoulder blade squeezes (30 seconds)
3. Neck retractions (30 seconds)

Total: 2 minutes. Complete upper body reset.
