## Why It Matters for Desk Workers

Sitting without core engagement puts all the load on your spine. Your lower back muscles work overtime while your deep core stabilizers shut off completely. Hours of this daily leads to:

- Chronic lower back pain
- Postural collapse (slouching)
- Inability to sit upright without fatigue
- [Disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc) compression and degeneration

The stomach vacuum reactivates your [transverse abdominis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_abdominal_muscle)—your body's natural back brace—while you work.

## Office-Specific Technique

### Seated at Desk

1. Sit normally in your chair (don't need to adjust position)
2. Exhale all air completely
3. Draw belly button toward spine without breathing in
4. **Office cue:** "Pull belly away from desk edge"
5. Hold 10 seconds while breathing shallowly
6. Release, breathe normally for 15–20 seconds
7. Repeat 2–3 times

### Standing (Kitchen, Printer, Hallway)

Same technique as seated—works identically while standing.

### Walking to Meeting

Can perform while walking. Slightly harder to maintain but excellent practice.

## Best Office Timing

| Situation | Why It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Conference calls (muted) | No one can tell, productive use of listening time |
| Reading emails | Passive activity allows focus on hold |
| Waiting for files to load | Use micro-waits productively |
| In meetings | Completely invisible, improves posture while sitting |
| Video calls | Even with camera on, no visible movement |

## The Desk Worker Difference

For contractors, the stomach vacuum counters heavy lifting demands. For desk workers, it counters **the absence of demand**—your core has no reason to engage while sitting, so it simply doesn't.

!!! warning "The Sitting Core Problem"
    Your body is efficient. If a muscle isn't needed, it stops firing. After years of sitting, many desk workers have essentially non-functional deep core muscles. They can do crunches ([rectus abdominis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle)) but can't stabilize their spine (transverse abdominis).
    
    The stomach vacuum specifically targets what sitting destroys.

## Integration Tips

**Make it automatic:**

- Every time you open your email client → one set
- Every time you join a video call → one set  
- Every time you return from bathroom → one set
- Every time you sit down after standing → one set

**Track it simply:**

- Tally marks on sticky note
- Goal: minimum 10 sets per workday
- Takes less than 5 minutes total, spread across entire day

## Common Office Challenges

??? question "I forget to do it"
    Set calendar reminders every 2 hours initially. After 2 weeks, it becomes habitual. Or tie it to existing triggers (see Integration Tips above).

??? question "Hard to focus on work while holding"
    Start with just 5-second holds while your brain adapts to dual-tasking. The vacuum should eventually feel automatic, requiring no conscious attention.

??? question "My chair makes it harder"
    Soft, reclined chairs do make engagement harder. Sit slightly forward on chair edge, or adjust backrest to more upright position.

## What Success Looks Like

After 4–6 weeks of consistent practice:

- Can hold vacuum while typing, reading, talking
- Automatically engage core when sitting down
- Less lower back fatigue at end of day
- Better posture without conscious effort
- Can sit longer without discomfort
