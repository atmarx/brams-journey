# Neck Retractions (Office Adaptation)

<!-- TODO: Side-by-side showing forward head at computer vs corrected position -->

!!! danger "Critical for Computer Users"
    [Forward head posture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_head_posture) is the **signature dysfunction** of desk workers. For every inch your head moves forward, your neck supports an extra 10 pounds of load. Most computer users carry their head 2–3 inches forward—that's 20–30 extra pounds on their neck, all day, every day.
    
    **This is why you have [tension headaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_headache), neck pain, and upper back pain.**

The office adaptation uses your chair for feedback and addresses the specific forward-head triggers of screen work.

!!! tip "Quick Reference"
    - **Duration:** 3 × 10-second holds
    - **Frequency:** Every 30–45 minutes during screen work
    - **Visibility:** Subtle—looks like you're adjusting posture
    - **Best times:** After calls, before presentations, arriving at desk, leaving desk

## Why It's Critical for Desk Workers

### The Screen-Forward Head Pattern

| Activity | Head Position |
|----------|---------------|
| Reading screen | Forward |
| Typing | Forward |
| Video calls | Forward (leaning toward camera) |
| Phone use | Forward and down |
| Driving to work | Forward |

**Every work activity pulls your head forward.** Without active intervention, your head progressively migrates forward throughout the day.

### The Physics Problem

```
Head in neutral = 10-12 lbs on [cervical spine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae)
Head 1" forward = 20 lbs on spine  
Head 2" forward = 30 lbs on spine
Head 3" forward = 40+ lbs on spine
```

Your neck muscles work overtime supporting this extra load, leading to:

- Tension headaches (3–4 per week for many desk workers)
- Chronic neck pain and stiffness
- Upper back pain (muscles between shoulder blades)
- Shoulder tension
- Reduced breathing capacity (collapsed chest)

## Seated Version (Primary)

### Using Your Chair for Feedback

If you have a high-back chair:

1. Sit upright with upper back against chair back
2. Note where your head is relative to the headrest/chair back
3. Most people: head is 2–4 inches forward of chair back
4. Perform neck retraction until head touches or approaches chair back
5. **This is your target position**

### Technique

1. Sit tall, look straight ahead (not up or down)
2. Keep jaw relaxed, teeth slightly apart
3. **Pull chin straight back** (horizontal translation, not nodding)
4. Think: "Make a double chin" or "Slide head back on a rail"
5. Feel stretch at base of skull, engagement at front of neck
6. Hold 10 seconds
7. Release to neutral (don't let head drift forward)
8. Repeat 2–3 times

### Critical Form Points

| Do This | Not This |
|---------|----------|
| Horizontal movement back | Looking down (chin to chest) |
| Eyes stay level | Eyes drop or rise |
| Jaw relaxed | Jaw clenched |
| Shoulders stay down | Shoulders shrug up |

## Office-Specific Timing

| Trigger | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Arriving at desk** | Undo forward-head from commute |
| **After every conference call** | Video calls pull head toward screen |
| **Every 30–45 minutes of screen work** | Prevent accumulation |
| **Before presentations** | Posture correction + confidence boost |
| **Before leaving desk** | Reset for commute |
| **When you notice tension headache starting** | Interrupt the pattern |

---

## The Conference Call Protocol

Video calls are especially problematic—you lean toward the screen to see participants and appear engaged.

**Before call:** 3 neck retractions (posture preparation)

**During call:** 
- Sit back in chair
- Keep screen at eye level
- Resist urge to lean forward
- Quick retraction when muted

**After call:** 3 neck retractions (undo forward lean)

---

## The Headache Prevention Protocol

If you get regular tension headaches:

**Morning (arriving):**
- 5 neck retractions
- Hold final one for 20 seconds

**Every 30 minutes:**
- 2 quick retractions
- Set timer—don't rely on memory

**When headache starts:**
- Immediate 5 retractions
- 30-second hold on each
- Often stops headache progression

Many desk workers reduce headache frequency from 3–4 per week to 0–1 per week using this protocol alone.

## Common Office Challenges

??? question "I look down at my keyboard while typing"
    This is a major contributor to forward head. Solutions:
    
    - Learn touch typing (eyes on screen, not keyboard)
    - Raise monitor so eyes are at top third of screen
    - Consider ergonomic keyboard tray that positions keyboard higher
    - Do extra retractions to compensate until you can touch type

??? question "My monitor is too low"
    Most desk setups have monitors too low, forcing chin-down position. Raise monitor so top of screen is at or slightly below eye level. Use monitor stand, books, or adjustable arm. This single change reduces forward head significantly.

??? question "I feel tension in front of throat when I retract"
    You're using superficial neck flexors instead of deep stabilizers. Move more gently. Focus on "lengthening back of neck" rather than "pulling forward." Reduce range initially.

??? question "I get dizzy doing this"
    Stop immediately. This could indicate vertebral artery issues. See healthcare provider before continuing. This is rare but important to rule out.

??? question "One side of neck feels tighter"
    Asymmetric tension is common. Continue exercise—it helps balance over time. May also benefit from specific neck stretches for the tight side.

## Workstation Optimization

Neck retractions work better when your workstation isn't fighting you:

### Monitor Position
- Top of screen at eye level
- Directly in front (not angled)
- Arm's length away
- Consider monitor arm for adjustability

### Chair Setup
- Back support maintains natural spine curve
- Headrest at back of head (not pushing forward)
- Seated position allows feet flat on floor

### Laptop Users
- Use external keyboard + mouse
- Elevate laptop screen to eye level
- Or use external monitor when possible

!!! warning "Laptops Are Ergonomic Disasters"
    Using a laptop directly (screen attached to keyboard) forces you to either look down (neck strain) or reach up (shoulder strain). There is no good position. Always use external peripherals when working for extended periods.

## Signs It's Working

**Week 1:**
- Corrected position feels "wrong" or "weird" (it's just unfamiliar)
- Starting to notice how forward your head drifts
- Some neck muscle fatigue (deep flexors strengthening)

**Week 2–4:**
- Corrected position feeling more natural
- Reduced frequency of tension headaches
- Less end-of-day neck stiffness

**Month 1–2:**
- Head naturally sits further back
- Headaches significantly reduced or eliminated
- Upper back pain decreasing
- Catching forward head drift earlier

**Month 3+:**
- New default head position established
- Automatic correction when drift occurs
- Dramatic reduction in neck/headache issues
- Visible postural improvement (others may comment)

## Pairing with Other Exercises

Neck retractions work synergistically with:

- **Shoulder blade squeezes** — Complete upper spine reset
- **Scapular wall slides** — Opens chest, allows head to sit back
- **Doorway pec stretch** (Daily 8) — Addresses same forward-pull pattern

**Upper Body Reset Combo (90 seconds):**

1. Neck retractions — 3 × 10 sec
2. Shoulder blade squeezes — 3 × 10 sec
3. Quick scapular slides (if wall available) — 5 reps

Do this every 90 minutes for comprehensive upper body postural maintenance.
