# Doorway Pec Stretch — Three Angles

![Doorway pec stretch at three heights](../images/exercises/doorway-pec-stretch.jpg)
<!-- TODO: Image needed - three side-by-side showing low, mid, high arm positions -->

**Purpose:** Release tight chest muscles from forward work posture, allow shoulder blades to retract properly

**Duration:** 60 seconds at each of three positions, each side (6 minutes total)

## The Biomechanics

The [pectoralis major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectoralis_major) (chest) attaches from your [sternum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum) and [clavicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle) to your upper arm. When tight, it:

- Pulls shoulders forward and down ([protraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protraction_(kinesiology)))
- Prevents proper [scapular retraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retraction_(kinesiology)) (shoulder blades back)
- Contributes to rounded shoulders, [shoulder impingement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_impingement_syndrome), neck pain
- Restricts overhead motion

**Why three angles?** The pec has three sections:

| Section | Location | Stretched By |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Clavicular (upper) | Near collarbone | High arm position |
| Sternal (middle) | Center chest | Mid arm position |
| Costal (lower) | Lower chest | Low arm position |

You need all three angles to achieve complete release.

## Why This Matters for Contractors

Every forward-facing task tightens the chest:

- Hammering, drilling, sawing
- Carrying materials in front of body
- Driving with hands on wheel
- Looking down at plans and materials

Years of this creates a locked-forward shoulder position that causes pain and dysfunction throughout the upper body.

## How to Do It

### Setup

1. Stand in doorway or at corner of wall
2. Feet in split stance (one foot slightly forward for stability)
3. Position body so you can step through doorway

### Position 1: Low Angle (Lower Pec Fibers)

1. Place right forearm against doorframe
2. **Elbow at mid-torso height** (roughly belly button level)
3. Elbow bent at 90°, palm facing forward
4. Step forward through doorway with right foot
5. Feel stretch across lower right chest
6. **Keep shoulder blade pulled back and down**
7. Hold 60 seconds, breathing deeply

### Position 2: Mid Angle (Middle Pec Fibers)

1. Raise right elbow to **shoulder height**
2. Still bent at 90°, forearm vertical against frame
3. Step through doorway until stretch felt across middle chest
4. This often feels most intense
5. Maintain shoulder blade retraction
6. Hold 60 seconds

### Position 3: High Angle (Upper Pec and [Anterior Deltoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoid_muscle))

1. Raise right elbow to **ear height or slightly above**
2. Still bent at 90°
3. Step through doorway
4. Feel stretch in upper chest and front of shoulder
5. May stretch slightly into neck
6. Hold 60 seconds

**Repeat all three positions with left arm.**

## Form Critical Points

!!! danger "Critical: Scapular Position"
    Throughout ALL three positions, actively pull shoulder blade back and down. If shoulder rolls forward, the stretch becomes ineffective. Think "proud chest" position.

- **Shoulder blade retracted:** Back and down, not rolling forward
- **Elbow at 90°:** Maintains proper lever arm
- **Step through gradually:** Don't force—ease into the stretch
- **Breathe:** Exhale and step slightly deeper every few breaths
- **Head neutral:** Don't turn head toward stretching arm

---

## What It Should Feel Like

**Normal sensations:**

- Deep pulling across chest (4-6/10 intensity)
- Possible sensation into front of shoulder
- Feeling of chest "opening"
- Mild sensation into bicep (if very tight)
- Asymmetry (one side tighter than other)

**Should NOT feel:**

- Sharp shoulder pain or pinching
- Numbness or tingling in arm
- Neck strain
- Pain that makes you hold breath

---

## Variations

### Wall Corner Version

- Use corner of wall instead of doorway
- Arm flat against wall surface
- Same three heights
- Allows more precise positioning

### Lying Version (Floor or Foam Roller)

- Lie on back, arm out to side at 90°
- Gravity provides stretch
- More passive, less control
- Good alternative if shoulder is sensitive

### Single Arm Focus

- If one side dramatically tighter
- Do tight side → both sides → tight side again
- Double the work on the restricted side

## Troubleshooting

??? question "Shoulder pain (sharp or pinching) during stretch"
    - **Cause:** Likely shoulder impingement—arm angle too high for current ROM
    - **Solution 1:** Lower the arm angle significantly (start at belly button only)
    - **Solution 2:** Reduce how far you step through doorway
    - **Check:** Is shoulder rolling forward? Must maintain retraction
    - **Warning:** If sharp pain persists at any height, skip this and see PT
    - **Alternative:** Chest opener lying on foam roller

??? question "Don't feel anything in chest"
    - **Cause 1:** Not stepping far enough through doorway
    - **Solution:** Step farther forward, increase stretch
    - **Cause 2:** Shoulder blade not retracted
    - **Solution:** Actively squeeze shoulder blade back BEFORE stepping through
    - **Cue:** "Chest proud, shoulder back and down"

??? question "Neck tension when stretching"
    - **Cause:** Compensating with neck instead of using proper shoulder mechanics
    - **Solution:** Keep head neutral (looking straight ahead, not turned)
    - **Relax:** Consciously drop shoulders away from ears
    - **Check:** Are you holding your breath?

??? question "One side dramatically tighter than other"
    - **Reality:** Very common—dominant side usually tighter
    - **Solution:** Spend extra 30 seconds on tight side
    - **Approach:** Do tight side first, then both sides, then tight side again
    - **Timeline:** Asymmetry should reduce over 4-6 weeks

??? question "Feel it in bicep instead of chest"
    - **Cause:** Bicep is also tight (common with gripping work)
    - **Reality:** This is okay—you're getting bicep stretch as bonus
    - **Modify:** Slightly adjust arm angle to shift emphasis to chest
    - **Separate:** Add dedicated bicep stretch if needed

## Bram's Experience

**Week 1:** Right side (dominant) dramatically tighter than left. Could only hold 30 seconds at mid-position before overwhelming stretch. Shoulder kept wanting to roll forward—had to focus intensely on retraction. Felt mostly in front of shoulder rather than chest.

**Week 4:** Could complete full 60 seconds at all three positions. Finally feeling stretch in chest proper, not just shoulder. Noticing improved overhead reach at work. Asymmetry reducing.

**Month 3:** Full stretch comfortable, could go much deeper. Shoulder pain during overhead work eliminated. Could demonstrate proper form to crew without thinking about it. This became one of his favorite stretches—immediate relief after forward work.

## Real-World Impact

"I realized I'd been unable to reach straight overhead for years," Bram wrote. "I thought it was shoulder problems. It was just tight chest muscles pulling everything forward. Three months of doorway stretches and I have my overhead reach back. Game-changer for work."

Specific improvements:

- **Overhead work:** Installing ceiling fixtures without shoulder pain
- **Driving recovery:** After long drives, a few minutes of pec stretching restored shoulder position
- **Breathing:** Opening chest improved breathing capacity—ribcage could expand more
- **Posture:** Shoulders naturally sat further back without conscious effort

## Integration

The Doorway Pec Stretch is the **fifth stretch in the Daily 8** because:

- Addresses upper body after lower body focus
- Prepares shoulders for supine work that follows
- Can be done in short version (one position) for morning routine
- Full version in evening addresses all three pec sections

**Recommended:** 
- Morning: 1 position (mid-height), 60 seconds each side
- Evening: All 3 positions, 60 seconds each = 6 minutes total
