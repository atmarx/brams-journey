# Invisible Exercise 7: Hip Circles

![Hip circles demonstration](../images/exercises/hip-circles.jpg)
<!-- TODO: Image showing standing hip circles with motion blur/arrows -->

**Purpose:** Hip mobility, joint lubrication, range of motion maintenance, prevent hip stiffness

**Duration:** 10 circles each direction, each hip (90 seconds total)

---

## The Biomechanics

The [hip joint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip) is a [ball-and-socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball-and-socket_joint) designed for multi-directional movement. But modern life restricts hips to limited ranges:

- Sitting (locked in [flexion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion))
- Walking forward ([sagittal plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane) only)
- Driving (flexion + [external rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(anatomy)))

**What happens when ranges aren't used:**

| Problem | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Unused ranges stiffen | Restricted ROM |
| [Hip capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_of_hip_joint) thickens | Permanent tightness |
| [Synovial fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_fluid) doesn't distribute | Poor joint lubrication |
| Compensations develop | Knee and back pain |

**Hip circles** take the joint through its full available range, distributing synovial fluid and maintaining mobility in all directions.

## Why This Matters for Contractors

Physical work demands hip mobility:

- Kneeling and squatting to floor level
- Getting up and down repeatedly
- Climbing ladders and stairs
- Stepping over obstacles
- Lifting from ground level

When hips are stiff:

- Lower back compensates (back pain)
- Knees take excessive stress
- Getting up from floor becomes difficult
- End-of-day stiffness accumulates

---

## How to Do It

### Setup

1. Stand near wall, workbench, or truck for light balance support
2. Feet hip-width apart
3. Shift weight to left leg (right hip will circle)
4. Standing leg slightly bent

### The Movement

1. Lift right knee to hip height (or as high as comfortable)
2. **Move knee in large circle:** forward → out to side → back → across midline
3. Make circles as large as possible without pain
4. Think: "Drawing a circle in the air with your knee"
5. Complete 10 circles clockwise
6. Then 10 circles counterclockwise
7. Switch legs: left knee circles, 10 each direction

### Form Critical Points

- **Circle from the hip:** Not just moving knee—hip joint creates movement
- **As large as possible:** Maximize range without forcing
- **Smooth movement:** No jerking or bouncing
- **Standing leg bent:** Don't lock standing knee
- **Core engaged:** Stable torso, minimal swaying
- **Both directions matter:** Each direction accesses different ranges
- **Light support okay:** Fingertips on wall for balance

---

## What It Should Feel Like

- Gentle pulling/stretching in different positions
- Hip joint gliding through ranges
- Some "sticky spots" (areas of restriction—normal if not painful)
- Clicking/popping (common, usually benign if painless)
- Slight fatigue in hip flexors and stabilizers
- Warming sensation as joint mobilizes

**Should NOT feel:**

- Sharp pain
- Catching or grinding
- Instability
- Knee pain

## Variations

### Small Circles (Tight Hips)

- If large circles cause pain or can't achieve them
- Make smaller circles, focus on smooth movement
- Gradually increase size over weeks
- Better to do small circles correctly than large circles with compensation

### Seated Hip Circles

- Sit on edge of bench or bucket
- Lift one foot slightly off ground
- Circle from hip with knee bent
- Smaller range but still beneficial
- Good for breaks when already sitting

### Figure-8 Pattern (Alternative)

- Instead of circles, trace figure-8 with knee
- Hits similar ranges with different pattern
- Good variety after doing circles regularly
- Same rep scheme: 10 each direction

## When to Do It

Hip circles look like casual stretching or loosening up—normal job site behavior.

Best times:

- After extended kneeling or floor work
- Before squatting to pick up materials
- After getting out of truck
- Before/after ladder climbing
- Mid-morning and mid-afternoon (prevent accumulation)
- Any time hips feel tight

**Minimum:** Morning, mid-day, and before leaving work

## Troubleshooting

??? question "Can't lift knee to hip height"
    - **Cause:** [Hip flexor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_flexors) weakness or hip joint restriction
    - **Solution:** Start with knee at whatever height is comfortable
    - **Progress:** Height gradually increases over weeks
    - **Don't force:** Respect current range

??? question "Balance issues—can't stand on one leg"
    - **Cause:** Weak ankle stabilizers and/or poor [proprioception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception)
    - **Solution 1:** Use more hand support initially
    - **Solution 2:** Standing leg more bent (easier to balance)
    - **Solution 3:** Smaller circles require less balance
    - **Progress:** Balance improves rapidly in 2-3 weeks

??? question "Hip clicks or pops during circles"
    - **If painless:** Usually benign—tendons snapping over bone
    - **Continue:** Often clicking reduces with improved mobility
    - **If painful:** Reduce range, avoid position that causes pain
    - **Persistent painful clicking:** May indicate pathology—see professional

??? question "Sharp pain in groin"
    - **Cause:** Possible [hip impingement (FAI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoroacetabular_impingement) or [labral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabular_labrum) involvement
    - **Action:** Avoid the painful range
    - **Modify:** Smaller circles that don't access painful position
    - **Warning:** If persists, see healthcare provider

??? question "Circles are jerky/uncontrolled"
    - **Cause:** Poor motor control or restricted ranges creating "catch points"
    - **Solution:** Slow down significantly—5-6 seconds per circle
    - **Smaller:** Reduce circle size to range you can control
    - **Practice:** Smoothness comes with repetition

??? question "Lower back hurts during exercise"
    - **Cause:** Excessive pelvic movement or core not stabilizing
    - **Solution:** Engage core (slight stomach vacuum)
    - **Reduce:** Smaller circles with less pelvic motion
    - **Support:** Use more hand support to reduce balance demands

## Bram's Experience

**Week 1:** Could barely lift knee to mid-thigh height. Circles were tiny and jerky. Balance was terrible—needed heavy support. Clicking and popping in left hip (old injury). "Feels ridiculous. Like a flamingo trying to learn to dance."

**Week 2:** Knee height improving—almost to hip level. Circles smoother but still small. Balance getting better. Started noticing when hips were stiff during the day—would do circles immediately.

**Week 4:** Natural, controlled movement. Circles much larger and smoother. Balance solid enough to do without hand support (but still used for safety). Left hip clicking reduced noticeably.

**Week 8:** Could lift knee well above hip height. Large, smooth, controlled circles. Standing leg strong and stable. The improvement in hip mobility was dramatic—getting up from kneeling was now easy and pain-free.

**Month 3:** Hip circles became part of morning routine and job site breaks. Hips felt mobile and loose throughout day. Getting in/out of truck, up/down from floor, squatting—all effortless now.

**Month 6:** Complete hip mobility transformation. Could deep squat comfortably (hadn't been able to for 10+ years). No end-of-day hip stiffness. The clicking was essentially gone. Felt 20 years younger in hip function.

## Real-World Impact

"I didn't know hip stiffness wasn't normal. Thought everyone in their 40s had tight hips and difficulty getting up from the floor. Turns out: no. It's just lack of mobility work. Six months of daily hip circles and I move like I did in my 20s."

Specific improvements:

- **Floor work:** "Getting up from kneeling used to be this whole production—hands on knee, struggle up, pain. Now I just stand up. Like a normal person."

- **Truck entry/exit:** "Used to swing one leg out, then the other, slow and stiff. Now I just step out normally. Hips rotate freely."

- **Ladder climbing:** "Hip mobility affects how high you can step up. Better mobility = easier climbing, less strain."

- **Squatting:** "Picking things up used to require creative strategies to avoid pain. Now I just squat down, grab it, stand up."

- **End-of-day:** "Used to finish work barely able to walk normally—hips locked up. Now I feel mobile at 6pm."

## The Invisible Factor

Looks like casual stretching during a break. Maybe loosening up before/after squatting down. Completely normal job site behavior.

Could be interpreted as: "Bram's knee was bothering him, he's moving it around." Or just: "Taking a quick stretch break."

One minute of movement that prevents years of deterioration.

## Integration

Hip Circles are the **seventh of the Invisible 8** because:

- Address lower body mobility after upper body exercises
- Maintain hip function critical for all physical work
- Can be done quickly anywhere
- Look like normal stretching behavior

**Recommendation:** Morning, mid-day, and before leaving work. After any extended floor work or sitting.
