# 90/90 Hip Stretch

![90/90 Hip Stretch position](../images/exercises/90-90-hip-stretch.jpg)
<!-- TODO: Image needed - bird's eye view showing Z-shape leg configuration -->

**Purpose:** Open both hip rotations simultaneously, address sitting-induced hip tightness

**Duration:** 90 seconds each side, then 90 seconds alternating (4 minutes total)

## The Biomechanics

The [hip joint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip) is a [ball-and-socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball-and-socket_joint) designed for movement in all directions. Modern life destroys this:

- **[Internal rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(anatomy))** is lost first with sitting and age
- **[External rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(anatomy))** also becomes restricted
- The [hip capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_of_hip_joint) thickens in unused positions
- Compensation patterns develop at the knee and lower back

This position challenges both rotations simultaneously:

- **Front leg:** External rotation stretch
- **Back leg:** Internal rotation stretch

It's the single most effective hip mobility exercise—and the most challenging for most men.

## Why This Matters for Contractors

Every squat, kneel, pivot, and step requires hip rotation:

- Getting in/out of trucks
- Kneeling for floor work
- Pivoting while carrying materials
- Squatting to pick things up
- Climbing ladders

Limited hip mobility forces the lower back and knees to compensate. Fix the hips, and you fix problems above and below.

## How to Do It

### Setup

1. Sit on floor (or on yoga block/folded blanket if hips very tight)
2. Bend right leg in front, knee pointing forward
3. Right shin roughly parallel to front edge of mat (perpendicular to your body)
4. Right knee bent at 90°, right ankle flexed (toes pulled back)
5. Bend left leg behind, knee pointing to the left
6. Left shin roughly parallel to front edge of mat
7. Left knee bent at 90°, left ankle flexed
8. You've created a "Z" or "90/90" shape
9. Sit upright with spine vertical, hands on floor for support

!!! warning "Starting Position Alone Is a Stretch"
    For many people, just achieving this position is significant. If so, work here for 2-3 weeks before adding the forward fold progressions.

### Progression 1: Front Leg (External Rotation)

1. Keep spine tall
2. Hinge forward at hips (not waist—don't round back)
3. Walk hands forward in front of right shin
4. Feel stretch in outside of right hip and buttock
5. Hold 90 seconds, breathing deeply

### Progression 2: Back Leg (Internal Rotation)

1. Sit back upright
2. Lean torso gently toward left (toward back leg)
3. Place left forearm on floor if possible
4. Feel stretch in front and inside of left hip
5. Hold 90 seconds

### Switch Sides

Reverse the position (left leg front, right leg back) and repeat both progressions.

## Form Critical Points

- **90° angles:** Both knees should be at roughly 90°—this is what makes it work
- **Ankles flexed:** Toes pulled back, not pointed (protects knees)
- **Spine tall:** Don't round forward—hinge at hips
- **Both hips grounded:** If back hip lifts significantly, add elevation under seat
- **Breathe:** This is intense—breathing helps you stay in it

!!! tip "Jeff Cavaliere's Note"
    "If you can't get into this position without significant elevation or support, your hips are screaming for attention. This is your priority."

## What It Should Feel Like

**Normal sensations:**

- Deep stretch in outer hip/[glute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteal_muscles) (front leg)
- Stretch in [hip flexor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_flexors)/inner thigh (back leg)
- Intensity of 5-7/10 (this one is challenging)
- Possible trembling as muscles release
- Gradual deepening over the hold

**Should NOT feel:**

- Knee pain (either knee)
- Sharp pinching in hip joint
- Numbness or tingling
- Lower back pain

---

## Variations

### Elevated Version (Tight Hips)

- Sit on yoga block, folded blankets, or firm pillow (4-6 inches)
- Same leg positioning
- Height reduces demand on hip rotation
- Work here until you can sit flat

### Single Leg Version (Very Tight)

If 90/90 is too intense:

- Do pigeon pose instead (front leg at 90, back leg extended behind)
- Less demand on back hip
- Build up to full 90/90

### Supported Lean (Back Leg Emphasis)

- Place yoga block under forearm when leaning toward back leg
- Provides support for longer holds
- Allows deeper relaxation

## Troubleshooting

??? question "Can't get into position at all"
    - **Reality:** Extremely common for men 40+, especially with sedentary history
    - **Solution 1:** Sit on 4-6 inches of folded blankets or yoga blocks
    - **Solution 2:** Start with pigeon pose instead (one leg 90, other extended behind)
    - **Timeline:** May take 2-4 weeks of daily practice before sitting in position comfortably
    - **Don't force:** If pain exceeds 6/10, this position isn't appropriate yet

??? question "Knee pain in front or back leg"
    - **Cause:** Knee torquing due to limited hip mobility
    - **Solution 1:** Place thin towel under painful knee
    - **Check:** Is shin perpendicular? If angled, knee compensates—adjust position
    - **Warning:** Never force 90° if hip won't allow it—causes knee injury
    - **Alternative:** Reduce angle to 60-70° and work there

??? question "Back rounds forward when trying to sit upright"
    - **Cause:** Hips too tight for current flexibility—need more elevation
    - **Solution:** Add more height under buttocks (6-8 inches if needed)
    - **Reality:** If can't sit upright even on block, hips aren't ready
    - **Alternative:** Supine figure-4 stretch (lying on back, ankle crossed over knee)

??? question "Feel it in knee, not hip"
    - **Cause:** Past your current safe range of motion
    - **Solution:** Reduce range immediately—less knee bend, more elevation
    - **Rule:** Stretch should be felt in hip/glute/groin, NEVER in knee joint
    - **If persists:** Skip this stretch, see physical therapist

??? question "One side dramatically tighter than other"
    - **Reality:** Asymmetry is normal and expected
    - **Solution:** Spend extra time on tight side (double the duration)
    - **Don't force symmetry:** Work within each side's current range
    - **Timeline:** Asymmetry should gradually reduce over 2-3 months

## Bram's Experience

**Week 1:** Couldn't achieve position without significant props. Sat on stacked yoga blocks (6 inches), still couldn't get knees to 90°. Felt like his hips were "made of concrete." Humbling for a man who'd worked physically his whole life.

**Week 3:** Could sit in position (elevated) but no forward fold yet. Started feeling actual hip stretch rather than just limitation.

**Week 8:** Could sit flat on floor in position, beginning to fold forward slightly. The transformation was becoming visible.

**Month 6:** Comfortable in full position, could fold forward significantly. His hip mobility transformation was dramatic—could deep squat comfortably for the first time in over a decade.

## Real-World Impact

"This stretch humbled me," Bram wrote. "I thought I was tough because I could work through pain. Turns out I couldn't even sit on the floor in a basic position. My hips had been locked up for twenty years and I didn't know it."

Specific improvements:

- **Getting up from floor:** "Used to be this whole production—hands on knee, struggle up, pain. Now I just stand up. Like a normal person. Revolutionary."

- **Truck entry/exit:** "Used to have to swing one leg out, then the other, slow and stiff. Now I just step out normally. Hips rotate freely."

- **Squatting:** "Picking things up from ground level used to require creative strategies. Now I just squat down, grab it, stand up. Normal human movement restored."

- **Knee pain:** "I thought I had bad knees. Turns out I had bad hips that were torquing my knees. Fix the hips, knees stopped hurting."

## Integration

The 90/90 Hip Stretch is the **third stretch in the Daily 8** because:

- Requires warmed-up body (after Cat-Cow and Child's Pose)
- Addresses one of the most common and severe restrictions
- Prepares hips for the hip flexor stretch that follows
- Challenging enough that you want to be mentally ready

**Recommended:** Full 4 minutes in evening routine. Can reduce to 2 minutes (1 minute each side) in morning routine.
