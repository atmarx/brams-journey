# Shoulder Blade Squeezes (Office Adaptation)

![Office shoulder blade squeezes](../images/exercises/office-shoulder-blade-squeezes.jpg)
<!-- TODO: Image showing subtle squeeze at desk, perhaps rear view showing scapular movement -->

**No modification needed.** Shoulder blade squeezes work perfectly while sitting and are completely invisible to observers. This makes them ideal for constant use throughout the office day.

!!! tip "Quick Reference"
    - **Duration:** 3 × 10-second holds
    - **Frequency:** Every hour during keyboard/mouse work
    - **Visibility:** Completely invisible
    - **Best times:** While typing, during calls, in meetings, reading emails

## Why It Matters for Desk Workers

### The Keyboard Posture Problem

Computer work creates a specific postural pattern:

| Body Part | What Happens | Consequence |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Shoulders | Roll forward toward keyboard | Chest tightens, back weakens |
| [Shoulder blades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapula) | Spread apart ([protraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protraction_(kinesiology))) | Mid-back muscles stretch/weaken |
| Upper back | Rounds forward | [Thoracic kyphosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyphosis) increases |
| Mid-back muscles | Constantly lengthened | Become weak and inhibited |

**Your shoulder blades should sit flat against your back.** In most desk workers, they wing outward because the muscles that hold them in place ([rhomboids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhomboid_muscles), [middle trapezius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezius)) have become weak and overstretched.

### The Weakness-Pain Connection

```
Forward shoulder posture (from typing)
            ↓
Rhomboids and mid-traps stretched/weakened
            ↓
Can't hold shoulder blades back
            ↓
Shoulders roll further forward
            ↓
Chronic mid-back ache, burning between shoulder blades
            ↓
Upper back fatigue from sitting
```

Shoulder blade squeezes directly strengthen the muscles that reverse this pattern.

## Seated Version (Primary)

### Technique

1. Sit normally at desk
2. Hands can remain on keyboard, mouse, or in lap
3. **Pull shoulder blades together and back**
4. Think: "Squeeze a pencil between your shoulder blades"
5. Feel muscles engage between spine and shoulder blades
6. Chest opens slightly and lifts
7. **Critical:** Shoulders move BACK and slightly DOWN, not UP
8. Hold maximum contraction for 10 seconds
9. Breathe normally during hold
10. Release, rest 10–15 seconds
11. Repeat 2–3 times

### What You Should Feel

- Burning/tension in mid-back (between shoulder blades and spine)
- Shoulder blades moving inward toward spine
- Chest opening automatically
- Should NOT feel: neck tension, shoulders shrugging UP

### The Critical Distinction

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| Shoulders back and DOWN | Shoulders shrugging UP |
| Squeeze between blades | Neck muscles tensing |
| Chest opens naturally | Forcing chest out |
| Relaxed neck | Jaw clenching |

If you feel it mostly in your neck/upper shoulders, you're using the wrong muscles. Focus on "down and back" not just "back."

## Integration with Typing

One of the most powerful aspects of this exercise: **you can do it while typing.**

### The Typing-Squeeze Technique

1. Type normally
2. Between sentences or paragraphs, squeeze shoulder blades
3. Hold 5–10 seconds while continuing to work
4. Release
5. Repeat throughout typing session

This prevents the progressive shoulder roll-forward that happens during extended keyboard work.

---

## Office-Specific Timing

| Trigger | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Every hour of keyboard/mouse work | Counter forward-reaching posture |
| Before video calls | Better on-camera posture |
| After video calls | Release tension from screen focus |
| When you notice shoulders creeping forward | Immediate correction |
| During phone calls | Productive use of listening time |
| In meetings | Maintain posture during long sits |

---

## The Video Call Protocol

Video calls are particularly hard on shoulder posture—you lean forward toward the screen and tense up.

**Before call:**
- 3 shoulder blade squeezes (set your posture)
- Adjust camera so you don't need to lean forward

**During call (camera on):**
- Subtle squeezes while others are speaking
- No one can see shoulder blade movement from front

**During call (camera off):**
- More aggressive squeezes
- Combine with neck retractions

**After call:**
- 3 squeezes + 30-second final hold
- Release accumulated tension

## Chair Optimization

Your chair can help or hinder:

### Helpful Chair Features
- Backrest that supports upright posture
- Slight backward angle that encourages shoulders back
- Proper lumbar support (reduces compensatory rounding)

### Hindrance to Avoid
- Chair that tilts you forward
- No back support (stools, ball chairs)
- Seat too high or too low

**Advanced technique:** Adjust chair so backrest forces shoulders back slightly—makes good posture easier to maintain between squeezes.

## Common Office Challenges

??? question "I feel it in my neck instead of mid-back"
    You're using upper trapezius (shoulder shrug muscles) instead of mid-back muscles. Focus harder on "shoulders DOWN and back" before squeezing. Place one hand on your neck—if you feel it tense up, you're doing it wrong. Reduce intensity and focus on correct muscle recruitment.

??? question "Don't feel anything—seems pointless"
    Several possibilities:
    
    - Not squeezing hard enough (try maximum effort)
    - Very weak mid-back muscles (can't feel them yet)
    - Try placing hand between shoulder blades to feel movement
    - Try wall-press version from main guide to establish connection
    
    The sensation develops over 1–2 weeks of consistent practice.

??? question "My shoulders shrug up automatically when I try to squeeze back"
    This is upper trap dominance—very common. Practice the movement in stages:
    
    1. First, actively push shoulders DOWN
    2. Hold them down
    3. THEN squeeze back
    
    The "down first, then back" sequence helps isolate the correct muscles.

??? question "I can only hold for a few seconds before muscles give out"
    This indicates significant weakness—exactly what you need to address. Start with 3–5 second holds and build up. The muscles will strengthen rapidly (2–3 weeks to see major improvement).

??? question "One side stronger than other"
    Asymmetry is normal, especially for dominant-side mouse users. Spend extra time focusing on the weak side. Single-side practice can help: try squeezing just the weak shoulder blade while keeping the other relaxed.

## Signs It's Working

**Week 1:**
- Starting to feel mid-back engagement
- May feel sore between shoulder blades (muscles waking up)
- Becoming aware of how far forward shoulders drift

**Week 2–4:**
- Distinct burning sensation in mid-back during squeezes
- Can hold for full 10 seconds without fatigue
- Chronic mid-back ache starting to reduce

**Month 1–2:**
- Shoulders naturally sitting further back
- Less end-of-day upper back fatigue
- Coworkers may notice improved posture

**Month 3+:**
- New default shoulder position established
- Mid-back pain that was "constant background noise" largely gone
- Strong, confident squeeze on demand
- Natural correction when shoulders drift forward

---

## Pairing with Other Exercises

Shoulder blade squeezes pair naturally with:

- **Neck retractions** — Complete upper spine postural reset
- **Scapular wall slides** — Same muscle group, different movement pattern
- **Stomach vacuum** — Core + upper back = complete postural support

**The Desk Posture Reset (60 seconds):**

1. Shoulder blade squeezes — 3 × 10 sec
2. Neck retractions — 3 × 10 sec

Do this combo every hour. Takes 60 seconds. Completely invisible. Prevents most desk-related upper body issues.

## The Cumulative Effect

This seems like a small exercise. But consider:

- 8 hours of work
- Squeezes every hour = 8 sessions
- 3 reps per session = 24 squeezes per day
- 5 days per week = 120 squeezes per week
- 50 weeks per year = 6,000 squeezes per year

Each one takes 10 seconds. Each one strengthens your mid-back and corrects your posture. The cumulative effect over months is transformative.
