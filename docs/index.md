# From Inflammation to Healing

**A Contractor's Journey Through Mold Illness, Joint Pain, and Complete Recovery**

## About This Book

I accidentally wrote a book.  I had pinched a disc in my lower back, and after a particularly rough night, was worried enough to go to the ER to make sure I wasn't imminently imploding.  They sent me home with the worst of prognoses: if it doesn't get better in a week, go see an ortho—*better make an appointment quick, they book 12 weeks out*.  I had been bouncing other ideas and questions off of Claude.ai, so I thought I'd ask it about the specific issues I was experiencing.  I didn't want it building a medical history of *me*, so I told it I was writing a story about a guy with some back pain.  If you've used Claude before, you know it loves to write, and proceeded to help me construct an entire story arc around this character's back pain.  We wove many other healthy ideas together in an iterative effort, and the result (after months of back and forth) is what you see here.

This is Bram's story—a 45-year-old general contractor who went from barely able to climb a ladder to feeling better than he did at 35. It's also a practical guide to the protocols that made his recovery possible.

What you'll find here isn't quick fixes or miracle cures. It's a systematic, evidence-based approach to addressing chronic inflammation(1) through:

1.  **Chronic inflammation** is a prolonged inflammatory response that can last months or years, damaging healthy tissue. Unlike acute inflammation (which heals injuries), chronic inflammation is associated with conditions like arthritis, heart disease, and autoimmune disorders.[^inflammation]

- **Anti-inflammatory nutrition** — Food as medicine, not deprivation
- **Movement protocols** — Exercises that rebuild function without requiring gym time
- **Natural therapeutics** — Medicinal mushrooms and cannabis as legitimate medicine

## Start Here: Bram's Journey

!!! tip "Recommended Starting Point"
    **We recommend beginning with Bram's story.** The narrative weaves together the *why* behind each protocol, making the practical sections more meaningful and easier to implement.

Bram's journey unfolds in four parts:

**[Part I: The Unraveling](journey/chapter-1-when-did-it-start.md)** — How a strong, capable contractor slowly lost the ability to do his job, and why he almost didn't notice until it was nearly too late.

**[Part II: The Investigation](journey/chapter-3-crisis-point.md)** — The ladder incident that forced action, finding a doctor who listened, and discovering the hidden mold that was poisoning him.

**[Part III: The Recovery Protocols](protocols/index.md)** — Diet, supplements, cannabis, mushrooms, and movement—the multi-pronged approach that turned things around.

**[Part IV: The Transformation](journey/chapter-7-nine-months-taking-stock.md)** — Nine months to one year later: objective measures, unexpected benefits, and building a life around sustainable health.

## Who This Is For

This book is written for:

- **Contractors, tradespeople, and physical workers** whose bodies are breaking down from their work
- **Office workers** trapped in sedentary jobs feeling the effects of sitting disease
- **Anyone with chronic inflammation** looking for a comprehensive, evidence-based approach
- **People dismissed by conventional medicine** who've been told to "just lose weight" or "it's just aging"
- **Skeptics of natural medicine** willing to look at the evidence with fresh eyes

You don't need to be a contractor to benefit. Bram's story is specific, but the protocols are universal.
