# One Year: The New Normal

> *"The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new."*
> 
> — Socrates

One year after the ladder incident—the day his knee gave out, the day everything had to change—Bram returned to the same client's house to finish crown molding he'd started.

The same ladder. The same room. But a completely different man on that ladder.

He climbed smoothly, confidently. His knee held firm. His shoulders moved freely overhead. He worked for an hour without pain, without compensation, without fear.

*A year ago, I thought my career was over. Now I'm working better than I did a decade ago.*

## The Daily Practice

At one year, Bram's protocols had become completely automatic—no longer disciplines he forced himself to do, but habits woven into his life's fabric.

### Morning (6:00 AM)

- Wake naturally (no alarm needed)
- Mushroom coffee ([lion's mane](../protocols/mushrooms.md) + [cordyceps](../protocols/mushrooms.md))
- [Daily 8 stretches](../exercises/daily-8.md) while coffee brews (15-20 min)
- Anti-inflammatory breakfast (scrambled eggs with oyster mushrooms, avocado, greens)
- Supplements
- Review day's work, set intentions

### Throughout Workday

- [Invisible exercises](../exercises/invisible-8.md) every 60-90 minutes (automatic, no timer needed)
- Proper body mechanics (ingrained, reflexive)
- CBD as needed (rarely—baseline inflammation so low)
- Hydration (gallon of water daily)
- Real food lunch (prepared night before)

### Evening (6:30 PM)

- [Daily 8 stretches](../exercises/daily-8.md) (20 min, often while watching educational content)
- [Anti-inflammatory dinner](../protocols/anti-inflammatory-diet.md) (salmon/grass-fed beef, roasted vegetables including medicinal mushrooms, sweet potato)
- Bone broth with shiitake
- [Reishi tincture](../protocols/mushrooms.md)
- Low-dose THC if needed (2-3x/week, not daily)
- [Legs up the wall](../exercises/legs-up-wall.md) (10 min meditation)
- Read or engage in hobby
- Bed by 10 PM

### Weekly Rituals

- **Sunday:** Meal prep, bone broth, mushroom harvest, [chaga tea](../protocols/mushrooms.md) preparation
- **Monthly:** Mushroom foraging walks (seasonal), mycology club meeting
- **Quarterly:** Comprehensive bloodwork, Dr. Chen check-in

**Total time dedicated to health maintenance daily:** ~60 minutes (45 min stretching, 15 min food prep beyond cooking)

### Bram's Perspective

"People say they don't have time for health maintenance. I didn't either—until my body forced me to make time. Now I see: I don't have time *not* to do this. Sixty minutes of maintenance prevents hours of pain and limitation. It's the best ROI of anything I do."

## The Business Evolution

Bram's business had transformed alongside his health.

### New Business Model

- Fewer projects, higher quality
- Premium pricing for expertise and craftsmanship
- Built-in "body breaks" in project timelines
- Emphasis on longevity over speed
- Teaching component (workshops generate additional revenue)

### Marketing Angle

*"Sustainable Contracting: Built to Last—Projects and Bodies"*

His website featured his recovery story. Clients were drawn to someone who'd overcome adversity and brought that wisdom to his work. The authenticity resonated.

### Revenue Impact

Surprisingly, working less (fewer hours per project, longer timelines) generated equal or higher income because:

- Premium pricing justified by quality and expertise
- Less rework (better execution when not working through pain)
- Repeat clients and referrals (exceptional experience)
- Workshop income (modest but meaningful)
- No injury-related downtime (huge cost savings)

### Lifestyle Impact

More time for health, relationships, teaching, hobbies. Less time in pain, compensating, or recovering from overwork.

## The Unexpected Doors

Recovery opened possibilities Bram never anticipated.

### Writing

Emma suggested he write about his journey. "People need this information, Dad. And you can explain it better than most medical professionals because you've lived it."

He started a blog: **"The Contractor's Guide to Not Falling Apart"**

Topics included:

- Proper lifting mechanics
- Joint-sparing techniques for common trades
- Anti-inflammatory meal prep for busy workers
- Mushroom cultivation for beginners
- Mold illness recognition and recovery
- Cannabis for pain management (legal jurisdictions)

Within six months, the blog had 5,000 regular readers. Comments poured in: "This information saved my career." "My back pain is gone." "I'm growing mushrooms now!"

The blog became a book proposal. Publishers were interested. The book you're reading is the result.

### Consulting

Construction companies started reaching out: "Can you teach our crews injury prevention? Our workers comp costs are killing us."

Bram developed a half-day workshop for companies:

- Proper body mechanics for trade-specific tasks
- [Daily maintenance stretches](../exercises/daily-8.md) (can be done on site)
- Early warning signs of injury
- Inflammation management
- Creating sustainable work cultures

The consulting was lucrative. But more than money, it was purpose—preventing others from suffering what he'd suffered.

### Documentary Interest

A filmmaker found his blog, wanted to document his full protocol. "The intersection of environmental illness, natural medicine, and blue-collar wisdom is compelling. People need to see this."

The documentary project was in early development. Bram was ambivalent—did he want to be that public? But if it helped people, he'd consider it.

## The Relationship with Fungi

One year in, Bram's relationship with fungi had come full circle.

He was growing six species at home, foraging seasonally, using five different medicinal varieties daily, cooking with mushrooms 4-5 times per week, teaching cultivation to others, and making his own extracts.

The man poisoned by toxic mold was now a passionate mycophile—mushroom lover.

### The Symbolic Journey

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 2em 0;">

Poisoned by fungus → Fear of fungus → Curiosity about fungus →

Learning about fungus → Healed by fungus → Teaching about fungus

</div>

"It's not ironic," Bram explained to a workshop attendee. "It's the perfect illustration of complexity and nuance. Nature provides both poison and medicine. Often from the same kingdom, sometimes from the same genus. The difference is context, species, and knowledge.

"Fearing all fungus because some are toxic is like fearing all plants because poison ivy exists. You have to develop discernment.

"That's a metaphor for life, really. Things aren't simply good or bad. Context matters. Nuance matters. Understanding matters."

## The Gratitude Practice

Something unexpected emerged around month 10: gratitude.

Not gratitude for the suffering itself—that would be disingenuous. But gratitude for what the suffering revealed and required.

### What the Illness Forced

- Confronting mortality and limitation
- Admitting vulnerability and asking for help
- Questioning assumptions about health, medicine, and bodies
- Developing discipline and consistency
- Building community and connection
- Slowing down and paying attention
- Learning to listen to his body

### What Recovery Revealed

- The body's remarkable capacity for healing
- The power of systematic, sustained effort
- The value of evidence-based natural interventions
- The importance of addressing root causes, not just symptoms
- The strength that comes from vulnerability
- The joy of teaching and serving others
- Purpose beyond career and productivity

### Bram's Journal Entry, Month 11

> *"I wouldn't choose to go through this again. The pain, the fear, the limitation—I wouldn't wish it on anyone. But I also can't imagine who I'd be without this journey.*
> 
> *"The old Bram was rigid, isolated, proud in all the wrong ways. He measured worth by hours worked and weight lifted. He pushed through pain as a virtue. He distrusted anything he couldn't understand immediately.*
> 
> *"The new Bram is more flexible, more connected, humble in ways that create strength. He measures worth by quality of life and positive impact. He respects pain as communication. He's curious about what he doesn't understand.*
> 
> *"The illness broke the old Bram. The recovery built a new one. I'm grateful for who I'm becoming, even as I grieve who I had to lose to get here."*

## The One-Year Assessment

On the anniversary of moving out of the toxic house, Bram did comprehensive testing.

### Results

- All inflammatory markers normal or optimal
- Mold antibodies declining (body clearing)
- Nutritional status excellent across all markers
- Body composition: 195 lbs, 16% body fat (down from 215 lbs, 28% fat)
- Cardiovascular fitness: Excellent for age
- Functional movement assessment: No restrictions, no pain patterns
- Bone density: Normal (concern for future given inflammatory history)
- Sleep quality: Optimal on all measures

Dr. Chen's assessment: "From a medical standpoint, you're healthier than most 30-year-olds I see. You've not just recovered—you've optimized."

### The Sustainability Question

"Can I maintain this?" Bram asked.

"Can you maintain the practices? The protocols aren't temporary fixes. They're lifestyle. As long as you keep doing them, you keep the benefits."

"What if I slip? What if I stop for a while?"

"Then symptoms will gradually return. Not immediately, not catastrophically. But your body will remind you what it needs. The key is: now you have the knowledge and tools to course-correct quickly."

"So this is forever."

"This is forever. But Bram—you've made it your life. It's not burden anymore. It's just who you are now."

She was right. The protocols weren't separate from his life. They *were* his life. And that life was full, purposeful, and pain-free.

!!! tip "The Integration Principle"
    At one year, Bram's protocols were no longer "protocols" at all. They were simply how he lived:
    
    - **Morning stretches** weren't discipline—they were how he started his day
    - **Anti-inflammatory eating** wasn't a diet—it was how he ate
    - **Invisible exercises** weren't interruptions—they were natural movement
    - **Evening routines** weren't obligations—they were transitions to rest
    
    **The goal of any health practice is to become invisible—woven so deeply into life that it requires no willpower, no reminders, no motivation.**
    
    That's when transformation becomes permanent.
