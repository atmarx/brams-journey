# Mold Remediation Checklist

When to call professionals, what to look for, and verification steps to ensure your home is safe.

!!! danger "Critical Safety Warning"
    **If you have mold illness or sensitivity, do NOT attempt any mold remediation yourself.** Even with protective equipment, the exposure during cleanup can cause severe setbacks. Hire certified professionals and relocate during the process.

---

## When to Call Professionals

### Always Hire Certified Professionals For:

- [ ] Contamination over 10 square feet of visible mold[^epa-threshold]
- [ ] Toxic species identified or suspected ([*Stachybotrys*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stachybotrys_chartarum)/black mold)
- [ ] Mold in HVAC systems or ductwork
- [ ] Hidden mold (inside walls, under flooring, in crawlspaces)
- [ ] Structural water damage affecting building integrity
- [ ] Any situation where you have mold illness/sensitivity
- [ ] Mold resulting from sewage or contaminated water

[^epa-threshold]: The 10 square foot threshold comes from [EPA guidance on mold remediation](https://www.epa.gov/mold/mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide). Areas larger than this require professional containment and equipment.

### Consider Professional Help For:

- [ ] Musty odors with no visible source
- [ ] Health symptoms that improve when away from home
- [ ] Recurring mold despite previous cleanup
- [ ] Mold in multiple locations
- [ ] Any uncertainty about extent or species

## Finding Qualified Remediators

### Required Certifications

Look for at least one of:

- [ ] **[IICRC](https://iicrc.org)** — Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration Certification
- [ ] **[NORMI](https://normi.org)** — National Organization of Remediators and Mold Inspectors
- [ ] **[ACAC](https://acac.org)** — American Council for Accredited Certification
- [ ] **[RIA](https://restorationindustry.org)** — Restoration Industry Association

### Questions to Ask

**Before Hiring:**

1. "What certifications do you hold?"
2. "Are you licensed, bonded, and insured?"
3. "Can you provide references from recent jobs?"
4. "Will you provide a detailed written work plan?"
5. "What containment methods do you use?"
6. "Do you use HEPA filtration?"
7. "Is post-remediation testing included?"
8. "Do you address the moisture source, or just remove mold?"

**Red Flags — Avoid Companies That:**

- [ ] Offer same-day testing AND remediation (conflict of interest)
- [ ] Refuse to provide written documentation
- [ ] Use scare tactics or high-pressure sales
- [ ] Can't provide proof of certification
- [ ] Don't discuss moisture source correction
- [ ] Quote without seeing the property
- [ ] Guarantee "mold-free" results (impossible claim)

### Separating Testing and Remediation

**Best Practice:** Use different companies for testing and remediation.

| Role | Who Should Do It |
|------|-----------------|
| **Initial Testing** | Independent inspector (not remediator) |
| **Remediation** | Certified remediation company |
| **Post-Remediation Testing** | Same independent inspector or different third party |

This prevents conflicts of interest.

## Pre-Remediation Checklist

### Before Work Begins

**Documentation:**

- [ ] Written scope of work from remediator
- [ ] Cost estimate in writing
- [ ] Timeline for completion
- [ ] Containment plan described
- [ ] Air quality testing scheduled

**Your Preparation:**

- [ ] Remove or protect belongings in affected areas
- [ ] Identify items that may need disposal vs. cleaning
- [ ] Arrange alternative housing during remediation
- [ ] Notify neighbors if in shared building
- [ ] Document existing conditions with photos/video

**Questions Answered:**

- [ ] What PPE will workers use?
- [ ] How will they contain the work area?
- [ ] How will they prevent cross-contamination?
- [ ] How will debris be removed and disposed?
- [ ] What's the plan if they find more damage than expected?

---

## During Remediation

### What Proper Remediation Looks Like

**Containment:**

- [ ] Work area sealed with plastic sheeting
- [ ] [Negative air pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_room_pressure) maintained (air flows INTO containment, not out)
- [ ] [HEPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA) air scrubbers running continuously
- [ ] Worker entry/exit through sealed "airlock"

**Worker Protection:**

- [ ] Full [Tyvek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyvek) suits
- [ ] [N95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N95_respirator) or P100 respirators (minimum)
- [ ] Gloves and eye protection
- [ ] Boot covers or dedicated footwear

**Removal Process:**

- [ ] Contaminated materials removed carefully (not ripped out)
- [ ] Materials double-bagged in sealed plastic
- [ ] HEPA vacuuming of all surfaces
- [ ] Antimicrobial treatment of remaining structure
- [ ] Documented disposal of contaminated materials

**What They Should Find and Address:**

- [ ] All visible mold removed
- [ ] Mold on hidden surfaces (back of drywall, behind insulation)
- [ ] Water-damaged materials (even without visible mold)
- [ ] The moisture source that caused the mold

### What to Watch For (Problems)

- [ ] Workers not wearing proper PPE
- [ ] No containment barriers visible
- [ ] Dust or debris spreading to clean areas
- [ ] Strong chemical smells (some treatment is normal, overpowering is not)
- [ ] Rushing to finish faster than quoted timeline
- [ ] Reluctance to show you the work

---

## Post-Remediation Verification

### Before Accepting Work as Complete

**Visual Inspection:**

- [ ] No visible mold anywhere
- [ ] All damaged materials removed
- [ ] Structure is dry (verify with moisture meter)
- [ ] Area is clean and free of debris
- [ ] No musty odor

**Testing (Required):**

- [ ] Independent post-remediation air quality testing
- [ ] ERMI score < 2 (or significant reduction from pre-testing)
- [ ] Spore counts comparable to outdoor/control samples
- [ ] Written clearance report from independent inspector

**Documentation:**

- [ ] Before and after photos
- [ ] Moisture readings documented
- [ ] List of all materials removed
- [ ] Product data sheets for any treatments used
- [ ] Warranty or guarantee (if offered)

### Clearance Testing Details

**What "Clearance" Means:**

| Test | Pass Criteria |
|------|--------------|
| **[ERMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Relative_Moldiness_Index) Score**[^ermi] | < 2 (significantly lower than pre-remediation) |
| **Air Spore Count** | Indoor < outdoor for all species |
| **Stachybotrys** | Not detected or minimal |
| **Visual** | No visible mold growth |
| **Moisture** | All materials < 15% moisture content |

[^ermi]: The Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) was developed by the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/mold/microbiological-and-chemical-exposure-assessment-mold-analysis-methods) using DNA-based testing to quantify 36 mold species. Scores above 5 indicate elevated mold; above 10 indicates severe contamination.

**If Testing Fails:**

1. Do not accept work as complete
2. Require remediator to address remaining issues
3. Retest after additional work
4. Do not make final payment until clearance achieved

## Moisture Source Correction

**Mold will return if moisture source isn't fixed.**

### Common Moisture Sources

| Source | Correction |
|--------|-----------|
| Roof leak | Repair/replace roofing, flashing |
| Plumbing leak | Repair plumbing, replace damaged pipe |
| Foundation seepage | Exterior waterproofing, French drain |
| Condensation | Improve ventilation, add dehumidifier |
| High humidity | Dehumidifier, HVAC adjustment |
| Poor drainage | Grade soil away from foundation |
| Bathroom moisture | Improve exhaust ventilation |
| Crawlspace moisture | Encapsulation, vapor barrier, dehumidifier |

### Verification Questions

- [ ] What was the moisture source?
- [ ] Has it been completely corrected?
- [ ] What prevents it from recurring?
- [ ] Are monitoring systems in place?

---

## Post-Remediation: Moving Back In

### Before Returning

- [ ] Clearance testing passed
- [ ] No musty odors detected
- [ ] HVAC system professionally cleaned (if affected)
- [ ] All repairs completed
- [ ] Moisture monitoring plan in place

### First Month Back

- [ ] Monitor for symptom recurrence
- [ ] Check problem areas weekly for moisture
- [ ] Run dehumidifier if humidity > 50%
- [ ] Maintain good ventilation
- [ ] Address any water intrusion immediately

### Ongoing Maintenance

- [ ] Monthly visual inspection of previous problem areas
- [ ] Humidity monitor in previously affected areas (keep < 50%)
- [ ] Annual HVAC inspection and cleaning
- [ ] Immediate attention to any leaks or water intrusion
- [ ] Consider quarterly air quality testing first year

---

## Small-Scale Cleanup Guidelines

**Only appropriate if:**

- Less than 10 square feet of mold
- Non-toxic species (not black mold)
- On non-porous surface (tile, glass, metal)
- You have NO mold sensitivity
- Moisture source already fixed

### If You Must DIY (Small Areas Only)

**Protection:**

- [ ] N95 respirator (minimum)
- [ ] Disposable gloves
- [ ] Eye protection
- [ ] Long sleeves and pants
- [ ] Work in well-ventilated area

**Process:**

1. Isolate area (close doors, seal vents)
2. Dampen moldy surface (prevents spore release)
3. Clean with soap and water or diluted bleach (1 cup per gallon)
4. HEPA vacuum entire area after cleaning
5. Bag all contaminated materials in plastic
6. Shower and wash clothes immediately after

**After Cleanup:**

- [ ] Monitor for recurrence
- [ ] Address moisture source
- [ ] Consider professional testing to verify

!!! warning "When DIY Isn't Appropriate"
    If you feel worse after cleanup, or if mold returns within weeks, you likely have a larger problem requiring professional assessment. Stop DIY efforts and call a certified inspector.

## Cost Considerations

### Typical Cost Ranges

| Service | Cost Range |
|---------|-----------|
| Initial inspection | $300-600 |
| ERMI testing | $200-400 |
| Small remediation (1 room) | $500-2,000 |
| Medium remediation (bathroom, crawlspace) | $2,000-6,000 |
| Large remediation (multiple rooms, HVAC) | $6,000-25,000+ |
| Crawlspace encapsulation | $5,000-15,000 |
| HVAC cleaning | $500-1,500 |
| Post-remediation testing | $200-400 |

### What Affects Cost

- Size of affected area
- Type of materials involved (drywall vs. concrete)
- Accessibility (wall cavities, crawlspaces)
- Species of mold (toxic species require extra precautions)
- HVAC involvement
- Structural damage extent

### Insurance Considerations

- Many policies cover water damage but exclude mold
- Some cover mold "resulting from" covered water damage
- Document everything for potential claim
- Get inspection before filing claim (know what you're dealing with)
- Consider public adjuster for large claims

## Bram's Remediation Experience

**Initial ERMI Score:** 12.7 (extreme contamination)

**Scope of Work:**
- Complete bathroom tear-out
- Master bedroom wall section removal
- Crawlspace encapsulation + dehumidifier
- HVAC duct cleaning
- Total: $24,500

**Timeline:**
- 3 weeks for remediation
- 2 weeks additional for repairs
- Relocated to rental during process

**Post-Remediation ERMI:** 1.2 (safe)

**Key Lessons:**
> "The visible mold was maybe 20% of the total problem. Behind walls, in the crawlspace, in the HVAC—that's where most of it was hiding. Professional inspection was worth every penny."

> "I thought I couldn't afford remediation. Turned out I couldn't afford NOT to do it. My health was costing me more than the remediation every month I delayed."
