# Tracking Templates

What gets measured gets managed. These templates help you track symptoms, identify patterns, and see progress that's often invisible day-to-day.

!!! tip "Don't Overcomplicate It"
    Start with the Daily Symptom Journal. Add other trackers only if they'd be helpful. Some people thrive with detailed tracking; others find it burdensome. Find your balance.

## Tips for Effective Tracking

### Do's

- **Be consistent:** Same time of day, same metrics
- **Be honest:** Tracking inflated numbers helps no one
- **Review regularly:** Weekly reviews catch patterns; monthly reviews show trends
- **Celebrate wins:** Note improvements, no matter how small
- **Adjust based on data:** Use tracking to make informed protocol changes

### Don'ts

- **Don't obsess:** Tracking should take 5 minutes, not 30
- **Don't track everything:** Start with core metrics, add only what's useful
- **Don't compare to others:** Your baseline and progress are your own
- **Don't give up on bad days:** One data point doesn't define a trend

### Pattern Recognition

Look for:

- **Time patterns:** Worse in morning vs. evening? Worse on certain days?
- **Food correlations:** Symptoms worse after specific foods?
- **Activity correlations:** Better or worse after certain activities?
- **Sleep impact:** How does sleep quality affect next day?
- **Weather patterns:** Some people notice weather affects symptoms
