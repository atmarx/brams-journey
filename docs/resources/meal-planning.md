## Eating Out Strategy

When restaurants are unavoidable:

### Safe Orders

- Grilled fish or chicken (ask for olive oil, no butter)
- Steak (grass-fed if available)
- Large salad with protein (dressing on side, use olive oil + lemon)
- Steamed or roasted vegetables (ask for no butter)
- Bunless burger with side salad

### What to Avoid

- Bread basket (just say no thanks)
- Fried foods (inflammatory oils)
- Pasta and pizza (gluten)
- Creamy sauces (dairy, inflammatory oils)
- Desserts (sugar)

### Scripts

> "I have food sensitivities—can I get this grilled with just olive oil and salt?"

> "Could I substitute the fries/bread for a side of vegetables?"

> "I'm avoiding gluten and dairy—what would you recommend?"

## Budget Considerations

### Priorities (Where to Spend More)

1. **Wild-caught fish** — Avoid farmed salmon (inflammatory [omega-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-6_fatty_acid) ratio)
2. **Pastured eggs** — Better [fatty acid profile](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2904416/)
3. **Grass-fed beef** — When possible, or at least for ground beef
4. **Organic leafy greens** — Highest pesticide load in conventional (see [EWG Dirty Dozen](https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty-dozen.php))
5. **Quality olive oil** — Real [EVOO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil#Extra_virgin), not blended/adulterated

### Where to Save

- **Conventional "clean" produce** — Avocados, onions, sweet potatoes (thick skins)
- **Frozen vegetables** — Often cheaper, same nutrition
- **Whole chickens** — Cheaper per pound than breasts, use carcass for broth
- **Bone broth** — Make your own vs. buying (10x cheaper)
- **Bulk nuts** — Buy in bulk, store in freezer

### Weekly Budget Estimates

| Tier | Weekly Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Budget | $75-100 | Conventional produce, fewer fish meals |
| Moderate | $100-150 | Mix of organic/conventional, regular fish |
| Premium | $150-200+ | All organic, grass-fed, wild-caught |

## Common Challenges

??? question "I don't have time to cook every night"
    That's why meal prep exists. Sunday prep means weeknight "cooking" is just reheating. 5 minutes to assemble a meal from prepped ingredients.

??? question "My family won't eat this way"
    Cook the base meal anti-inflammatory, add their preferences on the side. Example: You eat salmon + vegetables; they add rice or pasta to their plate.

??? question "I travel for work frequently"
    Pack snacks (nuts, hard-boiled eggs). Research restaurants near hotel in advance. Request fridge in room for storing healthy options. Consider portable protein powder for emergencies.

??? question "This seems expensive"
    Compare to: medical bills, lost work time, medications, eating out. Prevention is cheaper than treatment. Start with budget tier and upgrade what you can.

??? question "I get bored eating the same things"
    Rotate proteins weekly. Try new vegetables. Experiment with spices and herbs. Same template, different variations.
