# 30-Day Starter Protocol

For those overwhelmed by the full content, here's where to start. Four weeks of progressive implementation—one manageable step at a time.

!!! tip "The 80/20 Rule"
    80% of results come from 20% of actions. This protocol focuses on the highest-impact interventions first. Master these before adding complexity.

## Week 1: Foundation

**Priority:** Environmental safety + Basic nutrition

### Environment

- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: Walk through your home. Note any musty smells or visible water damage.
- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: If you see mold or smell must, don't wait—schedule a professional inspection.
- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: Check obvious problem areas: bathroom, under sinks, basement, around windows.

### Diet (Elimination)

- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: **Eliminate:** Processed foods, added sugar, fast food
- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: **Add:** Vegetables at every meal
- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: **Hydrate:** Half your body weight in ounces of water daily (200 lb = 100 oz)

### Movement (Just Two Stretches)

- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: **Morning:** Cat-Cow (60 seconds) + Legs Up Wall (5 min)
- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: **Evening:** Cat-Cow (60 seconds) + Legs Up Wall (5 min)

That's it. Ten minutes total per day.

### Tracking

Start a simple journal:

| Metric | How to Track |
|--------|--------------|
| Pain level | Rate 0-10 each morning |
| Morning stiffness | Duration in minutes |
| Sleep | Hours + quality (1-5) |
| Energy | Rate 1-5 at end of day |

## Day 30 Assessment

At the end of 30 days, assess these markers:

### Objective Measures

| Metric | Week 1 Baseline | Day 30 |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Average pain (0-10) | _____ | _____ |
| Morning stiffness (min) | _____ | _____ |
| Sleep hours | _____ | _____ |
| Sleep quality (1-5) | _____ | _____ |
| Energy (1-5) | _____ | _____ |

### Subjective Assessment

- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: Do I have more good days than bad days?
- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: Is my pain trending down?
- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: Am I sleeping better?
- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: Do I have more energy?
- :material-checkbox-blank-outline: Are my joints less stiff?

### Decision Points

**If improving:** Continue protocol, slowly add more elements from full protocols.

**If no change:**

- Reassess environmental factors (mold, air quality)
- Consider functional medicine consultation
- Check supplement quality (are you using good brands?)
- Evaluate compliance (are you actually doing the protocol consistently?)

**If worse:**

- Stop any new supplements and reintroduce one at a time
- Rule out environmental exposure you may have missed
- Seek professional evaluation

## Common Week-by-Week Challenges

### Week 1 Challenges

!!! warning "The Sugar/Processed Food Withdrawal"
    Days 3-5 are often the hardest. You may feel irritable, tired, headachy. This is withdrawal—your body adjusting to stable [blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level) instead of the spike-crash cycle.
    
    **Push through.** It typically passes by day 7-10.

### Week 2 Challenges

!!! warning "The 'I Don't Have Time' Trap"
    Fifteen minutes of stretching feels impossible when you haven't built the habit. But you spend 15 minutes on your phone without noticing.
    
    **Solution:** Link stretching to existing habits. Stretch while coffee brews. Stretch before TV. Stretch right after waking, before checking phone.

### Week 3 Challenges

!!! warning "Gluten/Dairy Elimination Feels Restrictive"
    The first week without gluten and dairy is the hardest. You'll realize how much you relied on bread, pasta, cheese.
    
    **It's temporary.** You're doing a 2-week trial to see if these are triggers. If they're not, you can reintroduce. If they are, you'll feel so much better without them that the restriction becomes worthwhile.

### Week 4 Challenges

!!! warning "Meal Prep Seems Like Too Much Work"
    Sunday meal prep is a 2-3 hour investment. But it saves time and willpower all week. Without prep, you'll default to easy (often unhealthy) options.
    
    **Start simple.** Your first few prep sessions don't need to be elaborate. Grill some chicken, roast some vegetables, boil eggs. Add complexity later.
