## A Note on Using These Resources

These templates and guides are starting points, not rigid prescriptions. Bram adapted his protocols constantly based on what his body told him.

**Use these resources to:**

- Get started without reinventing the wheel
- Track progress objectively
- Maintain consistency
- Identify what works for you

**Don't use them to:**

- Beat yourself up for imperfect compliance
- Follow rigidly when your body says otherwise
- Replace professional medical guidance
- Skip the learning process

The goal is building sustainable habits, not perfect adherence to someone else's protocol.
