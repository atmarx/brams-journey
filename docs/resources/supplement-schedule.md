## Timing Rationale

### Why Morning with Breakfast

- **Omega-3:** Fat-soluble, needs food for absorption
- **Vitamin D:** Fat-soluble, needs food for absorption
- **B-Complex:** Can cause insomnia if taken late; provides energy
- **Curcumin:** Better absorbed with food and fat

### Why Evening with Dinner

- **Second Curcumin dose:** Maintains blood levels throughout day
- **Turkey Tail:** Some find it slightly sedating
- **Vitamin C:** Second dose for sustained antioxidant coverage

### Why Before Bed

- **Magnesium:** Promotes relaxation and sleep
- **Reishi:** [GABAergic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor) effects support sleep
- **Collagen:** Absorbed during sleep when body repairs

### Why Throughout Day

- **Lion's Mane:** Cognitive effects work best with morning dosing
- **Cordyceps:** Energizing—never after 2 PM
- **Chaga tea:** Gentle, can be consumed anytime
- **Probiotic:** With food, any meal
