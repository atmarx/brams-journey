# Bram's Journey — Project To-Do List

*Last updated: December 31, 2024*

## Before Launch

### Content
- [ ] **Add images** — All 28 exercise files have placeholder references ready at line 3
  - Path format: `../images/exercises/[exercise-name].jpg`
  - Create `/docs/images/exercises/` directory
  - Consider: photo vs illustration style, consistency across set
- [ ] **Final proofread** — One read-through for typos, awkward phrasing
- [ ] **Test all internal links** — Click-through verification

### Technical
- [ ] **Create images directory** — `docs/images/exercises/`
- [ ] **Favicon** — Small touch, adds polish
- [ ] **404 page** — Custom not-found page (optional but nice)
- [ ] **Build and test locally** — `mkdocs serve` full review
- [ ] **Choose hosting** — GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.
- [ ] **Deploy**

## After Launch

### Immediate (Week 1)
- [ ] **Jeff Cavaliere email** — Send permission request after New Year
- [ ] **Share with small test group** — Get feedback from real humans

### Short-term (Month 1)
- [ ] **About/Support page** — Your story (not Bram's), why you made this, "buy me a coffee" link
- [ ] **Vitaglo outreach** — Informal conversation about referral/discount code possibility
- [ ] **Buy Me a Coffee setup** — Or Ko-fi, Patreon, etc.

### As Needed
- [ ] **Contact method** — Way for readers to reach you (email? form?)
- [ ] **Social sharing cards** — OpenGraph images for link previews
- [ ] **Analytics** — If you want to know traffic (privacy-respecting options: Plausible, Umami)
- [ ] **Accessibility audit** — Screen reader compatibility, contrast ratios
- [ ] **Print/PDF version** — Some readers may want offline copy

## Notes

**Jeff Cavaliere references (6 total):**
- 4 exercise tip boxes (cat-cow, 90-90, hip flexor, hamstring)
- 2 credits in Further Reading

**Image inventory needed:** 28 exercise files + potentially journey/protocol illustrations

**Hosting considerations:**
- GitHub Pages = free, simple, good for static
- Netlify = free tier, nice deploy previews
- Cloudflare Pages = free, fast CDN
